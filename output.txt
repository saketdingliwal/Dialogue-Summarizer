Article ->  another problem with the study is that most -lrb- or at least more -rrb- people in the country very well might identify as christian ... __jyoshu__ , __s1__ do n't know how they conducted the study . __s1__ do n't know what questions they asked , or what they screening process was , or anything . __s1__ are just making up objections , and deciding without any factual evidence that they apply . yes , that 's the point . __s1__ had prefer to know the specifics . questioning a study is a very appropriate thing to do in any study , particularly if it 's used to __vilify__ a group of people . so then question , do n't just state that the study has a problem . and '' __vilify__ '' ? good grief ! where did __s1__ get that from ? __s1__ seem to be taking this a bit too much to heart . a study was done , and done well from all evidence that s2 have seen , and the results reported . no one is __vilifying__ anyone . if __s1__ can show an __actuall__ problem with the study , and not something hypothetical that __s1__ came up with , than please do so . it seems quite professionally done to me , but __s1__ go ahead and dig all __s1__ want . but if __s1__ are simply uncomfortable with the results , well , that ' s no reason to go around saying that people are n't doing their jobs or are out to __vilify__ others . er ... that 's why __s1__ pointed out the specific things __s1__ saw as a problem . are s2 in a bit of a reactionary mood today ? yeah , because in __s1__ 's experience in these forums , here and elsewhere , an enormous amount of attention is given to trying to make christianity look bad , through __generalizations__ , citing irrelevant studies , and __misrepresentations__ . see , the divorce rate of christians has no bearing whatsoever on the gay marriage amendment . or did s2 forget that ? no more than usual . you , however , are stating that some is a problem , as opposed to possibly a problem . as if s2 wanted to simply dismiss the results , rather than actually check their validity . that 's pretty reactionary . as long as people say that they are trying to protect the '' sanctity '' of marriage by keeping gays out it 's extremely relevant , or at least a very good __refutation__ .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ argues that most people in the country might identify as christian and that questioning a study is a very appropriate response to one that !!__vilifies__!! a group of people . they believe that there is a lot of attention given to trying to make christianity look bad through !!__generalization__!! , irrelevant studies and !!__misinterpretations__!! . they believe the divorce rate of christians has no bearing on the gay marriage amendment . s2 believes that __s1__ is making up objections and deciding without any factual evidence . he or she believes that objections should not be hypothetical , but actual proven ones . this person thinks that dismissing results , rather than checking validity is reactionary . this person thinks it is relevant as long as people say they are protecting the sanctity of marriage .
generated -> s1 do n't know what questions they asked , or what they screening process was , or anything . s1 are just making up objections , and deciding without any factual evidence that they apply . s1 are just making up objections , and deciding without any factual evidence that they apply .

Article ->  sorry , but people have certain natural rights -- keeping people from being religious infringes on that . __s1__ is not saying businesses ca n't legally do it -- they can -- __s1__ is saying __s1__ think it 's pretty unethical . it 's easy for __s1__ to sit back and say what __s1__ are saying when __s1__ dislike religion , but this is no different than an employer telling a gay employee they ca n't express themselves as being gay on the job . one is discrimination for being gay , the other is discrimination for being religious . if __s1__ are going to be for equality , then be for equality in all cases . not just picking and choosing __s1__ 's pet issues . once again __jyoshu__ ; s2 manage a fast food __resturant__ . do __s1__ agree that s2 do not have to serve boy scouts and evangelical __christains__ ? s2 's moral beliefs are against them s2 should have the right to turn away their business . after all they go against s2 's religious beliefs so s2 can refuse to serve , or even hire them . right ? if s2 use __s1__ 's logic s2 should __beable__ to do whatever s2 want and use s2 's religious beliefs as an excuse . mistaken notion ? she said clearly '' __s1__ have worked on plenty of legislation ... we enact the will of the people '' it sounds to me like she 's a legislator . that 's certainly the way it comes across -- how could s2 possibly take that any other way ? a better analogy would be if s2 were trying to force a jewish employee , whom s2 knew was jewish , to work on his sabbath rather than being willing to work with him about that . or to suddenly tell him he has to eat a pork sandwich or something . and remember , this is a different issue than __benignly__ serving food . we are talking about a major religious issue here -- gay marriage , to religious people , is like asking them to approve most any bad thing in society s2 can think of . s2 have to take the seriousness of the religious view into account here somewhat . why ? it is not s2 's problem they have evil religious values . do they work for the state or god ? does god pay their paychecks or do the taxpayers ? they just have to sign a civil contract . so what if that person is the only person able to do marriage contracts in the area . how does the state ensure that gay people can __exersize__ their right to marriage if the only person able to perform the marriage is exempted from __perfoming__ the marriage based upon religious beliefs ? __s1__ just think s2 are viewing this the wrong way -- making it more complicated than it is . it is simply a provision that allows a person to let someone else conduct the civil ceremony if their religious beliefs do n't allow them to do it . the same idea that would allow a jewish person to pass on eating pork if it were suddenly expected for him or her to do it when it was n't before . that 's all this is -- let 's not make mountains out of __molehills__ ... yet what if there is no one else in the community ? how is the government going to ensure gay people are able to __exersize__ their rights ? well , then __s1__ guess they need to ensure someone is there that will do it as well . gee , that darn religious freedom -- messing everything up , huh ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing a seemingly pending law that would permit marriage officials to decline to conduct gay marriages if they are opposed to them on religious principals . __s1__ finds it acceptable , while s2 complains about it . __s1__ proposes that it is easy for s2 to be unsympathetic because s2 dislikes religion . __s1__ acknowledges that he considers such religious objections to be evil . he suggests that because the individual licensed to perform a marriage is paid or licensed by the state , the individual should reflect the will and choices of the state and therefore perform gay marriages despite his or her personal religious objection to them . s2 suspects that the law may result in an effective denial of gay marriage .
generated -> s1 is not saying businesses ca n't legally do it to sit back and say what s1 are saying when s1 dislike religion , but this is no different than an employer telling a gay employee they ca n't legally do it . if s1 are going to be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality in all cases that

Article ->  who are __s1__ to say it is unjust ? who are 5 people to say a law is unjust ? we have a system that says the most votes for something wins . . we are the ones being oppressed by the majority that is who we are . it is our lives that are on the ballot and our rights that our being denied that is who we are . we are the ones who are being told we are second __calss__ citizens . we are the ones who are being told are families are not families . we are the ones who are told we are less then dirt . of course being a heterosexual __s1__ would not understand . __s1__ suggest s2 get a majority of people and change the law then . this is what happened during slavery ... they actually passed 3 amendments about it . the courts are n't the all knowing group of people that have enlightened minds about what is or is n't fair . s2 's whole case is based on saying the majority is always be ignored if someone objects to them . __s1__ am in the minority when it comes to abortion ... does this mean the court should listen to me and declare abortion illegal ? no because abortion does not effect __s1__ 's life personally . that __iis__ __waht__ we mean the courts should look at the __individuials__ life and decide upon that . if a law that the majority favors is unjust in an __individuials__ life then it must be over ruled for the __individuials__ sake . what ? that makes no sense . if a law is unjust to one person then it needs to be overruled ? of course __unjustice__ is defined by the person in question . s2 make no sense here . s2 still fail to understand how our courts work too . s2 want them to work a certain way as opposed to the way they were created under our constitution . __s1__ want a society that __oppresses__ people . if the law effects even one person __adversly__ then it is unjust and needs to be overturned . it only goes to prove that conservatives are heartless and want people to suffer . __s1__ want a society that is free to make laws and rules as it sees fit . __s1__ guess we __oppress__ child __molesters__ but __s1__ am ok with that .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ , a heterosexual , and s2 , a homosexual , discuss the !!__justness__!! of the legislative process , majority rule , and how the latter affects individuals and the gay community . s2 describes how the gay community is discriminated against , and !!__posits__!! that because laws regarding homosexuals impact them more directly than the general population , it is unfair to have a majority rule apply . __s1__ accuses s2 of not understanding the legal system and proposes that s2 find majority to have legislation passed , and not look to the courts to redress the discrimination . __s1__ !!__analogizes__!! that process to how slavery was abolished , and also !!__analogizes__!! the alleged oppression to the oppression that may be felt by anti-abortion advocates and child !!__molesters__!! as a result of majority rule .
generated -> unjust ? we are the ones who are being told are families are not families . s1 suggest s2 get a majority of people and change the law then . if a law is unjust to one person then it needs to be overruled ? no because abortion does not effect s1 's life personally that

Article ->  __s1__ wish . but however much __s1__ disagree with sullivan on many political issues , he 's right about that . the world did change when the mass. legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights . it may be a big change in a small state , but it is a recognition that the winds of change are blowing against homophobic bigotry . __s1__ are just going to have to get over it . the world just is n't as anti-gay as it used to be . and that means that __s1__ are going to have to accept equal rights eventually , as gay marriage . presumably __s1__ will hope than in a few years , bigots in massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality . __s1__ think you 'll be out of luck . __s1__ wish that s2 wish . do __s1__ just like to argue for the sake of being argumentative ? __s1__ have picked out the one single thing s2 said there that __s1__ could disagree with and are making an issue of it , not even willing to agree on anything else s2 said . but fine , go ahead and think this is some __world-changing__ event if it makes __s1__ feel better . well , clearly __s1__ did n't even read s2 's post . -lrb- shrug -rrb- s2 have often posted here that s2 oppose gay marriage . that means s2 oppose equal rights for gays . if s2 have changed s2 's mind , and hope that massachusetts does n't overturn gay marriage , s2 would have said so . since s2 did n't , s2 do n't . no , __s1__ said __s1__ s2 '' will hope than in a few years , bigots in massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality '' . s2 had said , very plainly , that s2 think such legislation is an __over-intrusion__ by the government . clearly __s1__ did n't read s2 's post . are s2 claiming now s2 are in favour of legal marriage for gays in massachusetts now the legislature has voted for it ? because if so , that would be a change . s2 is saying that s2 would not want an amendment put in place banning it , because that would be an __over-intrusion__ into peoples ' lives by the government . so naturally , s2 would n't want such an amendment voted into creation , either , and that 's why s2 took issue with __s1__ 's claim that s2 would . that 's been s2 's position here for as long as s2 remember . and it 's a true conservative position -lrb- as opposed to __neocon__ -rrb- , __btw__ . are s2 saying that s2 are not in favour of a government ban on gay marriage ? s2 oppose doma laws ? does that mean s2 are now , contrary to s2 's previous posts , in favour of legal recognition of gay marriage ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing a legislative action associated with a massachusetts court ruling which is favorable to gay rights . __s1__ is enthusiastic about the matter and sees it as a step in the right direction against bigotry , and a recognition that the world is not as anti-gay as it used to be , which s2 is advised to acknowledge and accept . __s1__ also accuses s2 of being inconsistent in having been on the record on the website opposing gay marriage -lrb- and !!__therefor__!! according to __s1__ being opposed to equal rights for gays -rrb- , but now also taking a position that the state should not intervene to ban gay marriage . s2 defends that position and argues it is based on conservative principles against intrusions into individual lives .
generated -> the world did change when the mass. legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights . it may be a big change in a small state , but it may be a big change in a small state , but it is a recognition that the winds of change are blowing against homophobic bigotry .

Article ->  certainly not yours . s2 should know that __s1__ am for no marriage in government . it should be left to a religious institution where it will actually mean something . the states should then go back to doing something that actually makes sense and does n't reward people like britney spears for being white trash . that is all well and good , but it is not the religious ceremony and sanction that gays are looking for . they already have that ; there are churches that perform same-sex marriages . it is the civil benefits that are at issue . are __s1__ saying __s1__ would be in favor of __foregoing__ all the legal rights and benefits __s1__ are afforded by marriage ? for example * assumption of spouse s pension * automatic inheritance * automatic housing lease transfer * bereavement leave * burial determination * child custody * crime victim s recovery benefits * divorce protections * domestic violence protection * exemption from property tax on partner s death * immunity from testifying against spouse * insurance breaks * joint adoption and foster care * joint bankruptcy * joint parenting -lrb- insurance coverage , school records -rrb- * medical decisions on behalf of partner * certain property rights * reduced rate memberships * sick leave to care for partner * visitation of partner s children * visitation of partner in hospital or prison * wrongful death -lrb- loss of consort -rrb- benefits what do s2 say ? yeah __s1__ know . __s1__ is saying that there should be a better system . for example , if had a best friend who are roommates with ... both __hetero__ for the sake of argument ... and never wish to get married then could they get some of the benefits described ? __s1__ 's uncle actually was single until he died but he had a female friend who he was best friends with ... why could n't they get some kind of benefits if they so choose ? hospital __vistiation__ rights and things of that nature are obviously the most important in this kinda situation . it just seems the single folks are the ones getting screwed over in the marriage deal but gay folks are not ? to the single folks , s2 say get married . ok , lets use that logic ... . to the gay folks __s1__ say marry a woman . bet s2 are n't happy with that if want the benefits of marriage , get married . but ought to be able to marry a person of 's choice . 's suggestion would be to marry someone s2 do n't want to me married to , that is a different thing . it is not using '' that logic '' . s2 thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you . is n't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities ? s2 am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly . s2 happen to think that 's a bad idea . people get married for many reasons , some of which s2 would feel are not good reasons , but s2 would not make it illegal to do so . s2 am talking about the right to marry a person of 's choosing .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 discuss the civil benefits of marriage and how they could or could not be extended to single people and gay people . __s1__ is initially against government being involved in the equation , but after s2 describes many of the legal rights and benefits associated with marriage , such as automatic inheritance and hospital visitation rights , __s1__ is then able to relate to the issues by considering the case of his life-long bachelor uncle , suggesting that it is single people who are discriminated against by being excluded from the marriage benefits . s2 suggests that if a single person desires the benefits of marriage , they should marry , but that they should be able to marry a person of either gender as they see fit .
generated -> s2 should know that s1 am for no marriage in government . the states should then go back to doing something that actually makes sense and does n't reward people like britney spears for being white trash . it is the civil benefits that are at issue .

Article ->  this site shows a large range of historical instances of gay marriage . romans did it , so did __celts__ , greeks this one focuses on marriage in __american-indian__ tribes , and how the homosexuals were actually greatly valued as healers and __prophets__ . just take a look at the old testament to find marriages between one man and many women . polygamy is also present in african and islamic culture too . and in some tribes in nigeria , there is a culture of __polyandry__ -lrb- one woman , many men -rrb- . so marriage is not some one man , one woman thing that has been adhered to since time began . as an ' ideal ' , it 's far more recent that __http__ might think . smiley marriage has always been about different genders . s2 made no mention of solely one to one . if __http__ look closely at history __http__ will find that marriage -lrb- a couple of __bhuddist__ sects apart -rrb- has always been between opposite genders . there have been cultures where homosexual relationships have existed for short periods and often for specific cultural purposes but marriage per se has been between opposite genders . evidently s2 did n't read the links __s1__ gave you . to put it another way , there are many many examples of gay marriage throughout history . this idea that it is new and abnormal is ridiculous . smiley s2 clearly did , s2 suspect __s1__ may have but did n't understand . none of those unions were accepted to be marriage but unions for a particular purpose . marriage took place later between man and woman . __s1__ 's concept is new . that 's interesting !! s2 made the point about marriage having been an opposite sex institution before . __s1__ gave many examples of societies where same sex marriage was commonplace . s2 then said that they were n't really marriage because marriage was something new . now s2 are saying that same sex marriage has been against society 's beliefs since the year dot . so is marriage a new thing that is only a __male-female__ thing , or is marriage something that has been around since the year dot -lrb- and would include those examples that __s1__ gave - american indian __berdaches__ , gay marriage within early roman society etc -rrb- ? __s1__ assume early roman society falls within the __year-dot-till-now__ period . smiley same sex marriage has never been commonplace . there are a couple of __bhuddist__ sects who allow it . it was definitely frowned on in roman times . the greeks had homosexual liaisons , some from desire , some for a form of mentoring reasons . they were never marriages and never assumed to be so by those societies . those greek roman chinese and any other society accepted certain homosexual liaisons but marriage was something else . it was between people of opposite genders and that is not new it was how it was originally .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ presents the idea that gay marriage has been pervasive in many cultures , including the romans , greeks , __celts__ , and american indians . he also mentions the existence of other alternative forms of marriage such as polygamy and __polyandry__ . he claims that gay marriage is not a new idea and that the idea of marriage being between a man and a woman is a recent development . s2 claims that although homosexual acts did occur in many past cultures , these relationships were not marriages . he insists that marriages were almost exclusively between people of opposite genders . he argues that same-sex marriage has never been commonplace or accepted , despite homosexual acts occurring at times , and that the original idea of marriage is a union between people of opposite genders .

Article ->  it 's not bigotry that motivates me to oppose gay marriage . it 's the fact that it will hurt more people than it helps and that the benefits deserved by gays can be had without redefining . it 's just that simple . no bigotry ... just facts . just who in the hell is it hurting ? not me ... __s1__ is divorced ! __;-rrb-__ it hurts the people who view marriage as a sacred bond between a man and a woman ... and there is a bunch of them ... a big bunch ! __s1__ had say that bunch of people is about a hundred times greater than the little bunch that wants to destroy that idea . if it were such that the rights and benefits granted to married couples could not be granted to gays without allowing them to ' marry ' , then __s1__ had say the big bunch needs to suck it up and __relent__ . however , that is not the case . tough . real measurable damages , please . offending a bunch of folk 's sensibilities is n't damage . __appeasing__ faith justified hate however , is in a secular society . there 's no hate here . then let 's not be worried with the sensibilities of either bunch . if hurting s2 's sensibilities should not count , then the __legitimization__ of gay life should be __henceforth__ unimportant to you . the only consideration should be the rights . __s1__ say s2 are entitled to all the rights and __s1__ say that it is unnecessary to redefine marriage in order to get them . s2 will say that it -lrb- __redefinition__ -rrb- is the easiest way to assure the rights ... __s1__ say it is __unecessary__ . none of this constitutes bigotry . find a real fault with the argument that __redefinition__ is unnecessary . show some actual , measurable damages caused by not redefining . bull . s2 is not buying . one of s2 's all time favorite quotes ; '' s2 can see a church by daylight '' or if __s1__ prefer ; '' if it looks like a duck and __qucaks__ like a duck ... '' ... and __s1__ is not selling . if s2 want to claim __s1__ am a hate-filled bigot , please quote a passage where __s1__ expressed it . if s2 ca n't do that , find something else to throw __s1__ 's way . __s1__ have argued with cold logic , favoring nobody . there is no need to redefine marriage . dissatisfaction in not being eligible for marriage does not constitute a need . the evidence shows that people are n't interested in giving gays these benefits under another name . the simply are n't interested in granting them benefits at all . __seperate__ rules - will allow for different rules - and make it damned easy to ensure gays do n't actually get everything __heteros__ have . s2 do n't think __s1__ are a hate filled bigot - but s2 think most of those __s1__ seek to appease with __s1__ 's reasoning are . and jp stepped on s2 's last nerve recently .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that his opposition to gay marriage is based on the belief that it will hurt more people than it helps , not on bigotry . he suggests that it would hurt people with a traditional view of marriage as between a man and a woman , and that the benefits of marriage can be gained by homosexuals without redefining marriage . s2 argues that gay marriage does not hurt anyone , straight or gay , and offending proponents of traditional marriage is not a valid argument against it . he believes that preventing gay marriage is simply faith based hate . he claims that having separate rules for straight and gay marriage creates the possibility of those rules being different for the two groups , allowing the gay minority to be disenfranchised .

Article ->  __s1__ find it curious that every time someone makes the correct assertion that aids became an epidemic in the us through the gay community , gays and their pc __apologists__ immediately try to deflect the argument and want to talk about africa . __s1__ do n't give a flying f @ # $ about how it spread in africa ; __s1__ is talking about the usa . show me that __s1__ 's assertion is inaccurate and __s1__ will apologize , but do n't join the rest of the __apologists__ in trying to change the debate . the topic is aids in the us , not africa , not asia , not the south pole . the reason we bring up africa is to knock down the reason __s1__ bring up the stats in the us . __s1__ did n't just come along and start a chat about the progression of aids in the us . __s1__ threw it out as justification for those who oppose gay rights . if __s1__ want to use it like a weapon against gays - then expect tit for tat , jp . the topic is gay marriage in the usa . what part of that topic includes africa ? please try to keep up . statements like the above make s2 look __flighty__ . its __s1__ 's logic we are __refuting__ - location is irrelevant . location sure as hell is relevant . if __s1__ tell s2 that a bus hit a bunch of people in new york , why would s2 retort with 2 buses hit a group of people in africa ? it is an obvious attempt to deflect the focus away from the first statement , is it not ? it 's not __s1__ 's logic that s2 are trying to refute , s2 are trying to deflect the topic away from how aids spread in the us . if s2 want to refute __s1__ 's statement , show me some facts , not wishes , opinions , feelings , or other means of subterfuge . i 'll say it again for you . aids reached critical mass and became an epidemic in the us primarily via the gay community . if s2 do n't agree , show proof to support the contrary . it should n't be that difficult . if __s1__ is nothing but a __gay-bashing__ bigot who makes wild claims , then surely s2 can refute __s1__ 's claim with facts pertaining to the topic in bold , ca n't you ? but , if __s1__ is actually not a __gay-bashing__ bigot and have the facts to back up __s1__ 's claim , then s2 had better continue with the subterfuge , deflection and dismissals because all s2 will have is fraudulent pc rhetoric . s2 would n't unless __s1__ were using it as justification to ban buses in new york . exactly the point s2 am trying to make to , jp . thank you .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that the gay community is the cause of the aids epidemic in the us and that homosexuals and their advocates attempt to divert attention from this fact by tracing the origin of the disease to africa . he believes that the existence of aids in africa has nothing to do with aids in the us and that it should be ignored . s2 argues that discussing aids in africa is relevant to aids in the us and point out how aids is used as a justification for those who oppose gay rights . he suggests that the statistics regarding aids in africa show that it is not simply a homosexual disease and that aids should therefore not be used as a justification to make gay marriage illegal .
generated -> the topic is aids in the us , not asia , not the south pole , not the south pole . the reason we bring up africa , not asia , not the south pole , not the south pole , not the south pole , not the south pole . s1 did n't just come along and start a chat about the progression of aids in the us . if s2 do n't agree , show proof to support the contrary , it should n't be that difficult .

Article ->  it seems to me that the point there is that it is not a bigot ... er , spade merely because __s1__ call it a spade . __imo__ , if someone has to resort to name-calling , it tends to only indicate they are having to resort to something besides sound arguments . oh my . perhaps we should say it 's an anti-gay bias , or a person with an __anit-gay__ bias ? are the terms __acceptance-challenged__ , __inclusion-challenged__ , anti-discrimination challenged , appealing to you ? e __mutz__ or his '' joe '' , assumed those protesting against gay discrimination are nuts or trying to hijack heritage , but wo n't say why . if it walks like a duck and __quacks__ like a duck , chances are ... or maybe he 's simply arguing a different point than you . __imo__ it 's just simply arrogant of s2 to automatically write off disagreement as '' bigotry '' . your view is that this is about '' acceptance '' ; but that does n't mean that 's the real issue . e __mutz__ is right in saying that disagreement is not the same as bigotry . what is the basis for the disagreement or the different point of view if it is not a lack of acceptance of homosexuality or its visible and open displays and representations ? but the problem is that s2 insist on always __mischaracterizing__ that as bigotry . it 's a very ugly word , and __s1__ suspect that 's the reason s2 use it -lrb- for its effect -rrb- and why s2 do n't entertain the idea that bigotry may not always be what 's behind it . s2 say it is , and s2 explain why . replace the word '' gay '' with another minority , and tell me it is not . it 's an ugly thing . s2 have explained why s2 believe that 's what 's behind it . if __s1__ believe do n't believe that , why do n't __s1__ tell me what is behind it ? __s1__ think it all goes back to one 's motivations . what __s1__ do n't think s2 and some others understand is that people often do n't take that stand on the basis of not liking gay people . they do it because of the way they view marriage . if any other minority came along wanting marriage to be changed from one man and one woman , __s1__ suspect they had get the same response . we were n't just discussing marriage specifically . somehow whenever gays are involved , a group of people take a stand of being opposed , because of the way they view one thing or another in society , as being __straight-only__ , or excluding gays . yes , from the anti-gay crowd , sorry those who do n't wish to include gays . however , no other identified minority would want that , because only one minority identifies as gay . but it 's not always about __not-including-gays__ . that 's not the basis in many cases . -lrb- hey , that rhymes ! -rrb- it 's about the way they view marriage ! they had be that way toward any group wanting to change marriage to fit themselves if it changed marriage from the traditional view . __s1__ assure s2 if there was a movement afoot in this country by __polygamists__ to change marriage to include them , there would be a similar reaction toward that . it 's not that s2 are gay . it 's that s2 want to redefine marriage . ah , there 's no use . __s1__ have tried to get s2 to see this before .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that it is inappropriate to label disagreement as bigotry , and that while someone might think an argument is bigoted , it may be motivated by something other than bigotry . he argues that many people 's opinions are based on their view of marriage , not their dislike of homosexuals , and that they would be against any group wanting to alter the traditional view of marriage . s2 claims that opponents of gay rights are discriminatory and bigoted . he suggests that if you replaced gays with another minority , then the arguments against them would appear negative -lrb- e. g. , trying to exclude any other minority from getting married would not be acceptable -rrb- . he believes that opponents of gay marriage are not protecting traditional marriage , but are discriminating against homosexuals .

ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that aids was initially spread in the us primarily be homosexuals and that no one argues with this fact . he believes that the resources spent fighting the disease could have been better spent on other diseases such as cancer if the homosexual minority had not spread aids to the heterosexual majority with their promiscuous sexual activity . he !!__clarifies__!! that now that aids does exist , he does not advocate ignoring aids research . s2 agrees that aids was initially contracted and spread by homosexuals , but claims that its early spread was due to blood transfusions rather than sexual contact . he suggests that __s1__ believes that homosexuals are less important than !!__heterosexuals__!! based on his comment that other diseases are more important to cure than aids .

Article ->  yet s2 still will not answer the question . how does equal marriage hurt her or any heterosexual ? if she has her way __s1__ am the one that is hurt . __s1__ 's way of equal marriage __s1__ am not hurt nor is she . yes s2 did , in this post . s2 __summarize__ so what if a proposed law '' hurts '' you ? there are all kinds of laws that '' hurt '' all kinds of people . but is glad to see that s2 abandoned s2 's silly argument that it would be a violation of the first amendment to enact her religious belief about marriage , but not a violation of the first amendment to enact your religious belief about marriage . now , if s2 could only justify why only laws which do not cause '' harm '' to others are allowed to be enacted . frankly am astounded by s2 's affinity for the '' harm principle '' when s2 say things like '' do n't know about the '' culture war '' but am at war with evangelical anti gay christianity . will do whatever it takes to knock then down . '' because __s1__ am only concerned with rights of gay people . gay people are __s1__ 's first concern . this evil woman should come out and __sayshe__ is anti gay . she should come out and say she does n't want gay people to get married . she should admit that she wants gay people to remain second class citizens . why does n't she own up to her discrimination ? she wants to protect her heterosexual __privledge__ . for the record __s1__ own that statement and stand behind it . __s1__ will talk people out of attending these bible churches . __s1__ will do what __s1__ can to legally disrupt any __rundrasining__ activities they have going . __s1__ will protest their wedding ceremonies . __s1__ will protest their church services . as far as __s1__ am concerned , once they crossed over the line and started pushing for and getting laws enacted that hurt me , __s1__ 's family , __ands__ __s1__ 's people , they have no place in society . and __s1__ have yet to show why this is not a legitimate viewpoint , nor a legitimate way to legislate this issue . it 's obvious that all __s1__ care about is gay people . however , __s1__ have not shown why anti-gay -lrb- as __s1__ call them -rrb- people should not be able to legislate their view . all __s1__ have said is that __s1__ do n't like their view . big deal , they do n't like __s1__ 's view either . thus , in a democracy like ours , the majority of people decide issues like this . besides that , s2 think coming out in support of a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage qualifies as '' com -lsb- ing -rsb- out and say -lsb- ing -rsb- that she does n't want gay people to get married . '' this is fine . but also understand that it is legitimate for people who believe like ms. __musgrave__ to do the same , including to use the democratic process to have her view enacted in law . if __s1__ are free to do it , then she is as well . should the majority have the right to __enslave__ their fellow citizens ? should the majority have the right to lock people up in concentration camps ? a majority of the people in the us once thought it was a good idea . oh __s1__ want the evil woman to say it . __s1__ want her __viciousness__ and ugliness out in the open . if she is anti gay then she needs to own up to her bigotry repent america believes in protesting and disrupting gay gatherings . why if they can do this __s1__ can do the same . the majority did have the legal right -lrb- unfortunately -rrb- to __enslave__ their fellow citizens until the 13 th amendment took that option off the table . incidentally , it took a majority of people to take slavery off of the table . in the united states , the majority wins -lrb- for good or for ill -rrb- . s2 hope __s1__ are not trying to make a comparison between the denial of marriage to gays -lrb- and to 10 year olds , and to those who are currently married yet want another husband / wife , and to those who wish to marry their father , etc. -rrb- on the one hand , and slavery and / or concentration camps on the other . ok , and what would that accomplish ? yeah , that 's exactly what s2 said .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are talking about how democracy is based on majority rule and whether or not its fair . __s1__ believes it is completely unfair that gay marriage be dismissed or disliked and s2 argues that no matter what __s1__ believes is right or wrong , the majority of people control what is normal in our society . that if __s1__ is only towards the rights of gay people it is completely understandable for this lady to be in belief that marriage as is is fine . s2 believes that __s1__ 's argument is not a legitimate viewpoint because __s1__ has no justification that this lady hates gays . __s1__ believes that because this lady is not in favor of gay marriage , the lady is anti-gay . __s1__ is taking an aggressive approach by saying they will talk to bible churches and disrupt them because she feels like she has no place in society . __s1__ thinks that the majority of people is !!__enslaving__!! their people by not allowing gay rights , but s2 argues that it happens that way and it changes over time .

ref_sum ->  this is about gay marriage . __s1__ seems to believe that someone is making religion into law by saying marriage should be between a heterosexual couple . s2 is arguing that __s1__ 's point is not very valid because __s1__ is not understanding that they are not using the persons perspective . __s1__ believes that that person is trying to hurt them , while s2 is saying that the person may not necessarily be that way and that the person may be arguing for what they believe to be greater for society , based on their own perspective . __s1__ 's religious view of marriage is based on two people 's love for each other , while the other person believes its between a man and woman . s2 says __s1__ 's argument is empty and that __s1__ is not showing how the other person is being hurt by gay marriage . s2 thinks __s1__ is not understanding the overall perspectives and just focusing on their own needs . __s1__ states that the person 's religion put into law affects peoples ability to marry if they are gay , but that __s1__ 's religion on marriage put into law would not affect marriage for anyone .

Article ->  __lesz__ , __s1__ 's marriage means a great many things to me , none of which have anything to do with our governments . __s1__ 's question to s2 is what do __s1__ think marriage should mean to our governments ? well , marriage is an ancient human institution , based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans , and is one of the foundations of social stability . why would it surprise anyone that government might wish to support it ? what really surprises me is to find how many alleged christians now find it __expedient__ to demand government '' get out of marriage '' , simply because gay people want to get in it . bunch of hypocrites -- they never complained about government regulating marriage before this . now , while s2 agree it is n't absolutely essential for government to be involved in the regulation and support of marriage , it is nevertheless a convenience that few people would really want to throw away . -lrb- mr. __writela__ has summed it up eloquently so s2 need n't elaborate . -rrb- alas , many are just too mean-spirited to share marriage with those pesky __homos__ , so they have jumped on the __get-out-of-marriage__ bandwagon -- which is n't going to go anywhere -- as camouflage for their real feelings . that government would wish to be involved in any aspect of our lives , would not surprise me . that is what governments tend to do . consider the '' healthy marriage initiative '' . this is our government and as citizens , we would be well advised to exercise vigilance to prevent our government from __intruding__ into areas where there is no necessity . just because a few mean-spirited hypocrites may advocate that the government get out of marriage for the wrong reasons does not mean that the idea is all bad . never happen ? enlist the 100 single people who have the biggest stake in this issue and chip away at the exclusive benefits . start with an easy one like hospital visitation and work up to the tough ones like social security to spouses why ? why is it in the interests of society to prevent government involvement in marriage ? that 's what __s1__ have n't explained . __mrwritela__ pointed out the reasons that government involvement is pretty much unavoidable , if only because government is the source of law . it seems to me __s1__ advocate the replacement of marriage with a plethora of minor and specific legal contracts that would only benefit the lawyers writing them . it 's the wood and the trees . if specific laws are trees , then marriage is the forest that protects our relationships from such gales that xxxx . is there any specific advantage to looking to individual trees and ignoring the wood ? __lesz__ __s1__ ask why and s2 ask why not . why should government get out of the marriage business 1 . it is not needed 2 . the current marriage benefits are terribly unfair to single people that are forced to pay for them . __s1__ 's __eloquence__ notwithstanding , have found it useful to look very closely at the trees when solving problems . would suggest that one can not understand the wood unless one knows something about trees . also , have often found it useful to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller parts and solving the easiest parts first . why is government support of marriage unfair to single people ? single people do not have the same issues as married people . having been married and single myself , s2 do have some insight here . and why would rather married people go to lawyers for multiple legal contracts to cover all the hundreds of rights and mutual obligations currently conferred by marriage ? are a lawyer in need of clients ? __;-rrb-__ s2 's own experience of woods and trees is that there is no value in looking at them in only one way . one needs to consider them as trees and woods . __s1__ have also been single and married . experience but not much insight . __s1__ would be interested to hear s2 's views about this difference in issues and how these issues are helped by government involvement . __lesz__ , __s1__ am an engineer , not a lawyer . well , single people live by themselves , not as a family . by definition , they do not have a significant relationship -- and no , s2 do n't count boyfriends or girlfriends here , s2 am referring to committed couples who live together as a family unit . there are many legal issues such as inheritance , pension and social security rights , adoption and child custody , home ownership , etc. , which would need separate legal contracts without the umbrella of marriage . -lrb- and of course , even then such contracts would only be enforceable by government . -rrb- s2 myself had tremendous difficulties sorting out property issues with s2 's partner 's family after he died . it all but __bankrupted__ me , and there would n't have been any issue at all had it been legal for us to get married . we did have some legal contracts pertaining to the house , and wills , but alas they were n't good enough to get his family off s2 's back , because our legal relationship was trumped by his familial one . s2 am not saying it could n't be done piecemeal , tailor-made to suit each individual couple , but would n't that be excessively inconvenient -- for everyone but the lawyers ? whereas at __prresent__ , when __s1__ get married for a $ 25 license , hey presto , __s1__ get those protections and the lawyers have to defer their caribbean cruise .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are debating the topic of what marriage should mean to our government . __s1__ believes it is not a bad idea because they think it is not necessary for the government to be involved in most aspects of our lives , while s2 is questioning why it 's necessary to try and remove government involvement when it is unavoidable . __s1__ brings up that because several people are against the government due to gay marriage and not because it 's just marriage altogether , it does n't mean it 's not a bad idea to remove government intervention . __s1__ mentions the `` healthy marriage initiative '' and how it is n't necessary . s2 says that there is too much legal work and documents behind marriage in the government , such as inheritance , pension and social rights , etc. . , and that it would be a lot more work if the government did n't intervene , also stating that removing marriage from government will only benefit lawyers . both __s1__ and s2 have had experience with marriage , s2 states that marriage benefits are good because of government intervention .
generated -> marriage '' an ancient human institution , based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans , and is one of the foundations of social stability that alas , many are just too mean-spirited to share marriage with those pesky homos , so they have jumped on the get-out-of-marriage bandwagon . why is it in the interests of society to prevent government involvement in marriage ? that

Article ->  in the sense that saying one supports gay rights but not gay marriage , sure . but __s1__ have no problem with that inconsistency . however , s2 are for gay marriage , __ergo__ , it makes more sense s2 had be bothered by that inconsistency . but if not , fine . whatever ... -lrb- and yes , __s1__ know s2 have given me s2 's ' reasons ' . does n't mean there 's no inconsistency there . it just means s2 think it 's not something that should be challenged right now . -rrb- again , s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't understand why __s1__ keep saying it 's an '' inconsistency '' . it 's not a matter of it being a '' problem '' , but rather a question of why __s1__ repeatedly label it as an '' inconsistency '' . just to try to put this plainly . __s1__ and biden have both stated the same opinion . against gay marriage , but for gay rights in every other way . with __s1__ 's stated opinion statement , s2 do n't see an inconsistency . but __s1__ do see an inconsistency with __s1__ 's stated opinion statement . quite frankly , s2 really have n't seen __s1__ show an inconsistency yet . __s1__ have said '' inconsistency '' , but not show it . it 's a bit like saying '' frank is inconsistent on the abortion issue '' , but that 's it . it would be showing an inconsistency to show frank 's statement saying '' s2 am against all abortion '' , but then he has no problem with his wife getting an abortion cause she does n't want to lose her figure . nothing in his statement is '' inconsistent '' , __imo__ . if __s1__ say biden is '' inconsistent '' , __s1__ are also saying that about __s1__ 's position ... s2 know , if s2 are n't able to grasp the concept of the inconsistency of saying one is against gay marriage when saying they are for gay rights , __s1__ do n't know what else to say . it would be different if s2 did n't think gay marriage should be a right . but s2 do , so how could his position not be inconsistent to you ? to take s2 's abortion example , it would be like someone saying they are for reproductive / abortion rights , but yet being against it being legal for women to get an abortion at an abortion clinic . frankly , s2 are grasping at straws at this point . but that 's your position ... if __s1__ ca n't grasp that __s1__ are saying your own position is inconsistent , s2 do n't know what to say . yeah . __s1__ have no recollection of what s2 's position actually is , do you . as s2 have already explained to you , s2 see that a person can be for gay rights and against gay marriage . s2 see that a person can propose a compromise , that s2 personally would find acceptable . s2 ca n't tell __s1__ how many people have posted '' s2 do n't believe gay marriage is a right '' . if they also say '' s2 believe gays should have equal rights '' , there is no contradiction just cause s2 believe -lrb- let me repeat that , s2 believe -rrb- that gay marriage is a right . s2 think biden 's wrong . but his view is consistent . on another note , s2 am just amazed that __s1__ think __s1__ 's own position is inconsistent . s2 honestly had no idea ... are s2 just not reading the thread __????__ apparently not . let me repeat myself ... '' in the sense that saying one supports gay rights but not gay marriage , sure . '' __s1__ have already said __s1__ know it 's inconsistent , but that __s1__ do n't care . it 's not a pet issue for me . it is for you . yet s2 are far more concerned , it seems , about the inconsistency on __s1__ 's part than on biden 's part . yet it 's biden who 's s2 's candidate . stop the dishonesty of pretending __s1__ have n't already addressed that . actually , s2 did n't think __s1__ had recognized what __s1__ had admitted . next sentence __s1__ talked about biden ... '' more concerned '' ? s2 am arguing against the general position . it does n't matter who holds it . one of the points with biden , as explained in multiple points before , is how the perception of holding his feet to the fire could impact others ... if s2 could have a private one-on-one with biden , or if he logged on anonymously to this __web-site__ , s2 would discuss it with him just the same . quite frankly , the '' he 's our candidate '' thing is one of the things that takes precedent . see , we do n't approach these things as '' single issue '' type guys . we weigh the '' gay marriage opinion '' up against the impact of pushing him hard on it a few weeks away from election day , and balance the responding approach accordingly . s2 hear somewhere that '' single issue '' guys can be frowned upon . that ai n't us ...
ref_sum ->  it seems like they are discussing the inconsistency of each other 's arguments . __s1__ is getting annoyed and seems to just be arguing because they are `` venting '' while s2 is saying that the inconsistency is present and making all arguments invalid without proof . both __s1__ and s2 are for gay rights , s2 is stating that __s1__ is n't being consistent and `` admits '' to being inconsistent , while __s1__ is saying they do n't care about the inconsistency because of the point they are trying to get across . they bring up biden and abortion in ways that dont exactly fit the discussion , but just to show the inconsistency in each others opinions . s2 is saying they would handle this same situation with biden the exact same way because s2 is simply talking about perspective . __s1__ believes s2 is stating that __s1__ believes in gay marriage but not gay rights , which seems contradictory to __s1__ 's point . this argument does not have a set topic .
generated -> again , s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't mean there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency .

Article ->  because it 's all quite clear . decades of effort from the religious right , conservative republicans , and their like have made gay rights a poisoned topic . it 's a tragedy , but saying the right thing on this issue will cost s2 more votes than it will gain you , everyone knows it , and no one is going to do it . it 's politics 101 . the democrats , as a whole , want to do the right thing , but they know that if they say so too loudly they wo n't be in a position to do anything . they are forced to moderate their public stances so that they can get into positions where they can actually take action . this is of course a __generalization__ , but if s2 are talking about a political party as a whole that 's unavoidable . so , __s1__ are basically saying that biden was lying through his teeth when he said he does n't support gay marriage ? it was all just a lie to keep from losing votes ? interesting . possibly , __s1__ could n't say . certainly as a democrat he gets more benefit of the doubt than __s1__ would give a republican when it comes to gay rights , but __s1__ have n't __plumbed__ his record enough to say for sure . and let 's be honest here , s2 do not find the idea that a politician might be lying interesting . what s2 had prefer is that the candidates be honest about their views , whether it 's popular or unpopular . but even knowing we are talking about political candidates -lrb- who may lie to get votes -rrb- , when a candidate says something is his or her view , s2 think we have to take them at what they say when they answer a question like that so directly and emphatically . otherwise , there 's little point in asking questions to begin with other than maybe watching the reaction of body language and how they would respond under pressure , and so forth . political discourse has to operate to where when a candidate gives a given view as his or her view , they are taken at their word that is their view . '' no '' ca n't mean '' yes '' and so forth . no , that 's too __niave__ an approach . we know politicians are going to tell some lies , __s1__ trust that 's a given . we , as political consumers , ca n't simply take politicians at their word . if we want to make informed decisions about candidates we need to develop the skills to make useful judgement calls about what they are saying . we need to figure out how often they lie , what they lie about , how big their lies are . obviously we should n't need to do this , it would be great if we could actually take our politicians at their word . bad the sad reality is that we ca n't , not at this stage anyway . in this particular case , if biden says he does n't support gay marriage __s1__ is just as likely to think it 's because he knows that open support could cost him the white house as any other reason . it 's sad that such double speak is needed , __s1__ had love it if enough courageous politicians stood forth and ended the political need for lies , but until that wonderful day __s1__ is not going to be naive and take everything they say at their word , nor am __s1__ going to jump up and down and point fingers at every __falsehood__ . i 'll try to judge the politicians by their actions , and their lies by their magnitude , scope , and quantity . s2 think __s1__ are misunderstanding me -- s2 do n't mean s2 think we should assume they are going to always tell the truth -- s2 mean we should put the expectation on them to be honest . __iow__ , honesty is what we should demand . if we are n't even going to do that , there 's no point in ever asking a political candidate a direct question . knowing they are going to lie is n't the same as having the expectation on them to be honest . s2 really do n't think it 's too much to ask our candidates to say what their views are . __s1__ just said yourself '' we need to figure out how often they lie , what they lie about , how big their lies are '' so , obviously , __s1__ believe it 's not really good that they are lying . there would be little point in asking them questions if we are n't going to hold to them to some level of expectation that they are going to say what they mean . sure , they lie , but if the words of politicians mean nothing , there 's little point in even having political discourse . political cynicism is no excuse to not put expectations on our candidates to be honest with the american people .
ref_sum ->  this is about politics and whether or not the lie in order to get more votes . __s1__ believes politicians sometimes may lie as long as its what is the majority , while s2 is saying that s2 is more concerned with the honesty of the candidates rather than whether they are lying or not . s2 says we should expect them to be honest , because that is what we should want from politicians . __s1__ argues that politicians seem to lie in order to get the position they want or sway people to become popular , while s2 thinks that we should rely on them to make the right decision . __s1__ seems to think that s2 is making an argument for their belief , but s2 is just trying to be honest and show the other perspective . they argue about politicians lying through discussing when politicians are asked questions and how they answer them . s2 finishes by telling __s1__ we should not label politicians and expect them to do and say the right , honest thing .
generated -> conservative republicans say the right thing on this issue will cost s2 more votes than it will gain you , everyone knows it , and no one is going to do it . it 's politics 101 , but if s2 are talking about a political party as a whole that 's unavoidable . so , s1 are basically saying that biden was lying through his teeth when he said he does n't support gay marriage ?

Article ->  we do n't just benefit from what is often considered the common , nuclear family . we benefit from families with adopted children , step children , families with no children at all . no it does not . prove it will come up , and also prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . marriage is that now . s2 are right , it has nothing to do with the bible . it has everything to do with the slippery slope logical __fallacy__ , which we have discussed in the forum ad __nauseum__ . it only shows that those opposed do not have an argument . s2 know the prospect of incest and polygamy is much less socially acceptable than gay marriage , so s2 try to erroneously tie polygamy and incest to gay marriage in people 's mind to strike fear in them , and hope their logical reasoning can be replaced by irrational fear . a married couple as the head of a home is considered a nuclear family it already has . the question of legality is what this whole issue is about . marriage is a legal __instituation__ , how could legality not come up . yes it is whoa ... hold up ... are __s1__ saying that only because gay marriage is less unacceptable that incestuous relations , that its ok to grant gay marriage but not sibling marriage ?? if the incestuous society begin to parade and protest , until society accepts them on the level that they accept gays now , what will __s1__ say then ? on what grounds should we discriminate against 2 siblings wanting to get married , particularly if they believe they truly love each other , or if they believe that they were born with that attraction ? this is classic __hypocracy__ . if 2 siblings want to love each other in their private lives , how is that any business of yours ? and what does irrational fear have to do with anything ? do __s1__ have an irrational fear of an incestuous or polygamous lifestyle ? based on what ? give me one reason why society __shouldnt__ accept an incestuous relation between two consenting adults then what may lead to incest and polygamy is the fact that marriage is a legal institution , is that what s2 are saying ? if so , these things may come up equally as a result of straight legal marriage or gay legal marriage or interracial legal marriage , or legal __inter-faith__ marriage or legal marriage with legal divorce , etc. . it does n't relate specifically to gay legal marriage at all . __s1__ was saying this is how many people attempt an argument against gay marriage , by attempting to incite fear by spouting off a parade of __horribles__ that have nothing to do with the issue of gay marriage . what if straight people are married and winged green monkeys come flying out of everyone 's derriere in the future ? what will s2 do then ? demonstrate how gay marriage specifically relates to incest and incestuous marriage and polygamy . this is the gay rights forum , not the incest forum . thats not what im saying . what may lead to incestuous marriage is if siblings or related people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . and what may lead to polygamous marriage is 3 or more people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . do __s1__ see a pattern here ? __ooooh__ . . nice way to snake out of the issue ... let me refresh __s1__ 's memory since __s1__ brought it up , what exactly does the social acceptance of any type of '' taboo '' relationship have to do with their right to be legally married ? is there a certain limit of '' __tabooness__ '' , and if __youre__ past that limit then no marriage for you ? and what fear are __s1__ talking about ? s2 is talking about people that love each other and want to tie the knot . how could that possibly strike fear in somebody ? please ... . yes , that 's true . yes , that 's true . are s2 saying love is the pattern ? well , love applies to straight marriages as well as gay marriages . love is not exclusive to gay marriages . if that 's the connection , we can just as easily say straight marriage will lead to incestuous marriage and polygamy . s2 are saying love will cause a slippery slope . it 's still __fallacious__ . the issue __s1__ brought up was why this __fallacy__ is often used , that is to create fear , because incest and polygamy are indeed considered so taboo . the issue is not the __tabooness__ of anything and everything , but how it is being used to distract from the issue of same-sex marriage , when there is n't a logical , rational argument against same-sex marriage . it 's an indication of desperation on the part of some of those who are against same-sex marriage . __s1__ have no reason to discuss the level of __acceptability__ or lack thereof of every single thing , before __s1__ accept one thing that is different from all those other things . __s1__ can deal with that one thing on all of its own merits and shortfalls , without being drawn into a false dilemma , either accept everything or else do n't accept one thing , as if those are the only two choices , __fallacy__ . gay marriage will change the definition of marriage from '' a legal union between a man and a woman '' to '' a legal union between any parties that love each other '' . if its ok for 2 people that love each other and want to tie the knot , then how could incest be a taboo ? based on what ? again with the double standard . gay marriage was considered just as much a taboo as incest or polygamy just a few years ago . being gay emerged from its taboo status through parades , promotional efforts , and , unfortunately , by spreading lies -lrb- i 'll deal with that in another thread -rrb- . however , incestuous people __didnt__ go through the process of parading their lifestyle in front of the world and practically begging for approval from society . so incest is still deeper in taboo status than homosexuality . why is it ok to deny incestuous relations the right to marry on the grounds that it is considered taboo , but ok to approve gay marriage on the same grounds ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are debating whether making gay marriage legal will open opportunities for other `` taboos '' in our society . __s1__ believes that in opening this opportunity for gay marriage , the definition of marriage will change and it will allow other issues like incest and polygamy to become legal . s2 accuses __s1__ of __hypocracy__ . in a sense , they believe gay marriage will have a sort of domino effect for other issues . __s1__ is arguing that using these other issues to be evidence for why !!__gay-marriage__!! should n't be allowed is not a valid argument . then __s1__ goes on to say that this tactic is used to instill fear to those who do not support those other issues . __s1__ understands the other issues , but does n't see the relationship between those and that of same-sex marriage . s2 keeps arguing that it __shouldnt__ be different figuring out whether one can approve gay marriage but not incest since they believe the two to be somewhat related .
generated -> prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . marriage is that now , and prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . it has everything to do with the slippery slope logical fallacy , which we have discussed in the forum ad nauseum .

ref_sum ->  this debate is about the 9th and how the federal constitution applies to marriage . __s1__ and s2 begin by talking about trolling and potentially starting a new debate on abortion , which does n't really have a lot of purpose in this conversation . s2 says that in saying people who want to get rid of gay marriage may have wanted to prevent __inter-racial__ and inter religious marriage . s2 states that maine 's vote on gay marriage was an opinion on gay marriage , rather than the 9th being how the federal constitution applies to gay marriage . s2 also says that bowers justice stevens does n't have the evidence to withstand his analysis . they also bring up lawrence v. texas and s2 states that even when majority wants a law it is n't enough for the constitution challenge of the law . s2 goes back to saying how __s1__ 's arguments are flawed and that its too repetitive for this conversation , because __s1__ has n't disproved anything . they go back to talking trash to each other and they end the conversation .

Article ->  another problem with the study is that most -lrb- or at least more -rrb- people in the country very well might identify as christian ... __jyoshu__ , __s1__ do n't know how they conducted the study . __s1__ do n't know what questions they asked , or what they screening process was , or anything . __s1__ are just making up objections , and deciding without any factual evidence that they apply . yes , that 's the point . __s1__ had prefer to know the specifics . questioning a study is a very appropriate thing to do in any study , particularly if it 's used to __vilify__ a group of people . so then question , do n't just state that the study has a problem . and '' __vilify__ '' ? good grief ! where did __s1__ get that from ? __s1__ seem to be taking this a bit too much to heart . a study was done , and done well from all evidence that s2 have seen , and the results reported . no one is __vilifying__ anyone . if __s1__ can show an __actuall__ problem with the study , and not something hypothetical that __s1__ came up with , than please do so . it seems quite professionally done to me , but __s1__ go ahead and dig all __s1__ want . but if __s1__ are simply uncomfortable with the results , well , that ' s no reason to go around saying that people are n't doing their jobs or are out to __vilify__ others . er ... that 's why __s1__ pointed out the specific things __s1__ saw as a problem . are s2 in a bit of a reactionary mood today ? yeah , because in __s1__ 's experience in these forums , here and elsewhere , an enormous amount of attention is given to trying to make christianity look bad , through __generalizations__ , citing irrelevant studies , and __misrepresentations__ . see , the divorce rate of christians has no bearing whatsoever on the gay marriage amendment . or did s2 forget that ? no more than usual . you , however , are stating that some is a problem , as opposed to possibly a problem . as if s2 wanted to simply dismiss the results , rather than actually check their validity . that 's pretty reactionary . as long as people say that they are trying to protect the '' sanctity '' of marriage by keeping gays out it 's extremely relevant , or at least a very good __refutation__ .

Article ->  sorry , but people have certain natural rights -- keeping people from being religious infringes on that . __s1__ is not saying businesses ca n't legally do it -- they can -- __s1__ is saying __s1__ think it 's pretty unethical . it 's easy for __s1__ to sit back and say what __s1__ are saying when __s1__ dislike religion , but this is no different than an employer telling a gay employee they ca n't express themselves as being gay on the job . one is discrimination for being gay , the other is discrimination for being religious . if __s1__ are going to be for equality , then be for equality in all cases . not just picking and choosing __s1__ 's pet issues . once again __jyoshu__ ; s2 manage a fast food __resturant__ . do __s1__ agree that s2 do not have to serve boy scouts and evangelical __christains__ ? s2 's moral beliefs are against them s2 should have the right to turn away their business . after all they go against s2 's religious beliefs so s2 can refuse to serve , or even hire them . right ? if s2 use __s1__ 's logic s2 should __beable__ to do whatever s2 want and use s2 's religious beliefs as an excuse . mistaken notion ? she said clearly '' __s1__ have worked on plenty of legislation ... we enact the will of the people '' it sounds to me like she 's a legislator . that 's certainly the way it comes across -- how could s2 possibly take that any other way ? a better analogy would be if s2 were trying to force a jewish employee , whom s2 knew was jewish , to work on his sabbath rather than being willing to work with him about that . or to suddenly tell him he has to eat a pork sandwich or something . and remember , this is a different issue than __benignly__ serving food . we are talking about a major religious issue here -- gay marriage , to religious people , is like asking them to approve most any bad thing in society s2 can think of . s2 have to take the seriousness of the religious view into account here somewhat . why ? it is not s2 's problem they have evil religious values . do they work for the state or god ? does god pay their paychecks or do the taxpayers ? they just have to sign a civil contract . so what if that person is the only person able to do marriage contracts in the area . how does the state ensure that gay people can __exersize__ their right to marriage if the only person able to perform the marriage is exempted from __perfoming__ the marriage based upon religious beliefs ? __s1__ just think s2 are viewing this the wrong way -- making it more complicated than it is . it is simply a provision that allows a person to let someone else conduct the civil ceremony if their religious beliefs do n't allow them to do it . the same idea that would allow a jewish person to pass on eating pork if it were suddenly expected for him or her to do it when it was n't before . that 's all this is -- let 's not make mountains out of __molehills__ ... yet what if there is no one else in the community ? how is the government going to ensure gay people are able to __exersize__ their rights ? well , then __s1__ guess they need to ensure someone is there that will do it as well . gee , that darn religious freedom -- messing everything up , huh ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing a seemingly pending law that would permit marriage officials to decline to conduct gay marriages if they are opposed to them on religious principals . __s1__ finds it acceptable , while s2 complains about it . __s1__ proposes that it is easy for s2 to be unsympathetic because s2 dislikes religion . __s1__ acknowledges that he considers such religious objections to be evil . he suggests that because the individual licensed to perform a marriage is paid or licensed by the state , the individual should reflect the will and choices of the state and therefore perform gay marriages despite his or her personal religious objection to them . s2 suspects that the law may result in an effective denial of gay marriage .

Article ->  matt , this is getting ridiculous . s2 made an assertion that republicans would send gays to concentration camps like the germans did in the holocaust . then s2 brought up a statement by paul cameron , as if paul cameron has anything to do whatsoever with republican politics or leadership . now if s2 had linked someone in the republican leadership saying those things , s2 might have something , but s2 did n't . paul cameron is a psychologist that has gone over the top at times with some of the things he 's said about gays and has paid a price for it . he 's a frequent target of the gay pride movement for __demonization__ and because he did n't tow the line with the apa 's political stances , they distanced themselves from him . __s1__ do n't agree with everything he says either , for that matter . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking ; the most s2 can say is that they are paul cameron talking . well , sure -- anything could happen . a military coup could take place and we had have martial law . a new ice age could start in the next year . an asteroid could be on its way to hit earth . but there 's a big difference between possibility and likelihood . paul cameron is the single most frequently quoted '' expert '' cited by the gop in all their attempts to limit the rights of gay people . his '' research '' has been entered in the congressional record countless times . it really is astounding that anyone would have anything to do with him . including you . what price ? without his revolting beliefs and __star-power__ , he had be flipping burgers somewhere . instead , he 's raking in a fortune speaking to the '' moral '' groups __s1__ are constantly defending . he was dismissed from the group for conducting fraudulent research . cameron talking ... gop repeating . seriously , __jyoshu__ , the man called for extermination . how can __s1__ support him or cite him or defend him at all __??????__ how can s2 not stay on point ? unless cameron is a part of the gop __leadeship__ , matt is pulling some wild point out of his hat , saying that because someone who may not even be a republican hates gays , that republicans hate gays . __s1__ might as well have said that since john lennon attacked religion , then democrats hate religion . yes , his comments are that ludicrous . this is not about paul cameron no matter how much s2 had love to change the subject , it 's about matt 's ridiculous __generalizations__ and comments . oh , and s2 need to get up with the times -- no national political party has used cameron 's information in a serious way in a long time . __s1__ is sure you 'll now be googling to try and find republican individuals out there on the internet citing cameron , but that 's not the party leadership or its platform . there is no republican in leadership that would call for the extermination of gays , and s2 know it . nor does the platform say so . so let 's put that little lie to bed right now . sorry , sir . since __s1__ did n't stay on point , s2 thought others were just as free to wander . if democratic legislators from sea to shining sea quoted lennon 's lyrics about '' imagine no religion '' at every session that talked about religious freedom , __s1__ might draw that conclusion , no ? __ooops__ . s2 thought it was about a conservative democrat in minnesota bragging about '' inside information '' from that state 's supreme court . uh ... how about the president of the united states ??? paul cameron 's research is cited in virtually every single attack on gay people in state after state after state legislature . it was presented in the '' debate '' about same-sex marriage in the u.s. __friggin__ ' senate . his name appears in the citations of virtually every legal brief filed by opponents of same-sex marriage . __http__ think he even made it into lawrence v. texas . the man is president of the family research institute . he can probably phone up ol ' __dubya__ anytime he gets the urge . and __dubya__ will put down his pretzel and pick up the phone . what should be put to bed is paul cameron and every single bogus study related to him . that supposedly reasonable people would even mention his name is surprising . ok , __s1__ now realize something __s1__ did n't earlier -- that __http__ are obviously a dnc __shill__ . no one else would make such a ridiculous __generalization__ . __http__ really do think that 's all conservatives talk about , huh ? __s1__ hate to bust __http__ 's bubble , but it 's not . __s1__ know __http__ 's martyr complex is important to you , but it 's just not accurate . -lrb- shrug -rrb- what are __s1__ talking about ? s2 said __s1__ had probably be right to assume that some people were __anti-religion__ if they consistently talked about what a wonderful world it would be without it ? over and over . at every opportunity . and never had a single nice word to say about it . ever . __s1__ really are laughable when __s1__ try to defend the gop when one of their admittedly most effective propaganda campaigns is to rally the '' __family-values__ '' crowd against gay rights . it 's openly admitted by them . they are proud of their tactics . very odd ...
ref_sum ->  this seems to be an argument about gay rights and !!__generalizing__!! the political beliefs of people . according to __s1__ , s2 talks about paul cameron and makes it seem as if he is the voice of the republicans . __s1__ argues that it is not the case and one person who sides with a specific party does n't represent the party . __s1__ uses john lennon as an example of this not being a proper way to !!__generalize__!! political views of parties , in his case the democratic party . __s1__ accuses s2 of making an assertion including the republicans creating another holocaust , because of the !!__generalization__!! that s2 made . s2 believes that paul cameron 's views are cited and used in many cases against gay rights because most people do share the same views , which __s1__ thinks otherwise . s2 says that most attacks on gay rights have cited paul cameron , even within the us senate , showing that he has a strong opinion in the republican party , or at least it seems so .
generated -> is a psychologist that has gone over the top at times with some of the things he 's said about gays and has paid a price for that matter . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking ; the most s2 can say is that they are paul cameron talking . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking ; the most s2 can say is that they are paul cameron talking . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking .

Article ->  certainly not yours . s2 should know that __s1__ am for no marriage in government . it should be left to a religious institution where it will actually mean something . the states should then go back to doing something that actually makes sense and does n't reward people like britney spears for being white trash . that is all well and good , but it is not the religious ceremony and sanction that gays are looking for . they already have that ; there are churches that perform same-sex marriages . it is the civil benefits that are at issue . are __s1__ saying __s1__ would be in favor of __foregoing__ all the legal rights and benefits __s1__ are afforded by marriage ? for example * assumption of spouse s pension * automatic inheritance * automatic housing lease transfer * bereavement leave * burial determination * child custody * crime victim s recovery benefits * divorce protections * domestic violence protection * exemption from property tax on partner s death * immunity from testifying against spouse * insurance breaks * joint adoption and foster care * joint bankruptcy * joint parenting -lrb- insurance coverage , school records -rrb- * medical decisions on behalf of partner * certain property rights * reduced rate memberships * sick leave to care for partner * visitation of partner s children * visitation of partner in hospital or prison * wrongful death -lrb- loss of consort -rrb- benefits what do s2 say ? yeah __s1__ know . __s1__ is saying that there should be a better system . for example , if had a best friend who are roommates with ... both __hetero__ for the sake of argument ... and never wish to get married then could they get some of the benefits described ? __s1__ 's uncle actually was single until he died but he had a female friend who he was best friends with ... why could n't they get some kind of benefits if they so choose ? hospital __vistiation__ rights and things of that nature are obviously the most important in this kinda situation . it just seems the single folks are the ones getting screwed over in the marriage deal but gay folks are not ? to the single folks , s2 say get married . ok , lets use that logic ... . to the gay folks __s1__ say marry a woman . bet s2 are n't happy with that if want the benefits of marriage , get married . but ought to be able to marry a person of 's choice . 's suggestion would be to marry someone s2 do n't want to me married to , that is a different thing . it is not using '' that logic '' . s2 thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you . is n't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities ? s2 am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly . s2 happen to think that 's a bad idea . people get married for many reasons , some of which s2 would feel are not good reasons , but s2 would not make it illegal to do so . s2 am talking about the right to marry a person of 's choosing .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 discuss the civil benefits of marriage and how they could or could not be extended to single people and gay people . __s1__ is initially against government being involved in the equation , but after s2 describes many of the legal rights and benefits associated with marriage , such as automatic inheritance and hospital visitation rights , __s1__ is then able to relate to the issues by considering the case of his life-long bachelor uncle , suggesting that it is single people who are discriminated against by being excluded from the marriage benefits . s2 suggests that if a single person desires the benefits of marriage , they should marry , but that they should be able to marry a person of either gender as they see fit .
generated -> s2 should know that s1 am for no marriage in government . the states should then go back to doing something that actually makes sense and does n't reward people like britney spears for being white trash . it is the civil benefits that are at issue .

'' because __s1__ am only concerned with rights of gay people . gay people are __s1__ 's first concern . this evil woman should come out and __sayshe__ is anti gay . she should come out and say she does n't want gay people to get married . she should admit that she wants gay people to remain second class citizens . why does n't she own up to her discrimination ? she wants to protect her heterosexual __privledge__ . for the record __s1__ own that statement and stand behind it . __s1__ will talk people out of attending these bible churches . __s1__ will do what __s1__ can to legally disrupt any __rundrasining__ activities they have going . __s1__ will protest their wedding ceremonies . __s1__ will protest their church services . as far as __s1__ am concerned , once they crossed over the line and started pushing for and getting laws enacted that hurt me , __s1__ 's family , __ands__ __s1__ 's people , they have no place in society . and __s1__ have yet to show why this is not a legitimate viewpoint , nor a legitimate way to legislate this issue . it 's obvious that all __s1__ care about is gay people . however , __s1__ have not shown why anti-gay -lrb- as __s1__ call them -rrb- people should not be able to legislate their view . all __s1__ have said is that __s1__ do n't like their view . big deal , they do n't like __s1__ 's view either . thus , in a democracy like ours , the majority of people decide issues like this . besides that , s2 think coming out in support of a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage qualifies as '' com -lsb- ing -rsb- out and say -lsb- ing -rsb- that she does n't want gay people to get married . '' this is fine . but also understand that it is legitimate for people who believe like ms. __musgrave__ to do the same , including to use the democratic process to have her view enacted in law . if __s1__ are free to do it , then she is as well . should the majority have the right to __enslave__ their fellow citizens ? should the majority have the right to lock people up in concentration camps ? a majority of the people in the us once thought it was a good idea . oh __s1__ want the evil woman to say it . __s1__ want her __viciousness__ and ugliness out in the open . if she is anti gay then she needs to own up to her bigotry repent america believes in protesting and disrupting gay gatherings . why if they can do this __s1__ can do the same . the majority did have the legal right -lrb- unfortunately -rrb- to __enslave__ their fellow citizens until the 13 th amendment took that option off the table . incidentally , it took a majority of people to take slavery off of the table . in the united states , the majority wins -lrb- for good or for ill -rrb- . s2 hope __s1__ are not trying to make a comparison between the denial of marriage to gays -lrb- and to 10 year olds , and to those who are currently married yet want another husband / wife , and to those who wish to marry their father , etc. -rrb- on the one hand , and slavery and / or concentration camps on the other . ok , and what would that accomplish ? yeah , that 's exactly what s2 said .

Article ->  agreed she is ignoring __s1__ 's religious freedom and trying to institute her religion into law . the law that will bar __s1__ 's family from legal protections . it wo n't protect her marriage but will bar me and __s1__ 's people from from being full citizens . she is n't protecting marriage but __perserving__ her heterosexual __privledge__ . how on earth is she impeding on __s1__ religious freedom ? she is n't trying to take away __s1__ 's right to any religious ceremony . with such a wide-open standard of what constitutes religious freedom that __s1__ seem to have , any legislation could be construed as imposing on religious freedom . because it is her religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman . __s1__ 's religious belief is that marriage is between two people that love each other regardless of sex . she is tying to place her religious __belif__ into law over mine . who gets hurt here ? if __s1__ 's religious belief is put into law she can still marry the person of her choice . if her religious belief gets put into law she can still marry the person of her choice but __s1__ do not get to . so __s1__ and __s1__ 's people are hurt by __codifing__ her religious belief into law . she is trying to keep gay people out of marriage and thus preserve her heterosexual __privledge__ . but by that definition , either one could be viewed as impeding on religious freedom , including __s1__ 's view impeding on hers ! we do n't define imposing on religious freedom on the basis of having different ideals . it does n't effect __s1__ 's religion or religious freedom if __s1__ do n't get benefits under gay marriages . __s1__ can argue in other ways , on other basis , but the idea that not giving gays marriage benefits is imposing on religious freedom is an empty '' argument '' . but s2 have not shown how she would be harmed by equal marriage ? __s1__ have shown that her definition infringes upon __s1__ 's religious freedom . if gay marriage becomes a reality then in no way does it infringe upon her in any way . would s2 care to explain how gay marriage infringes upon her in any way ? it is her heterosexual __privledge__ and her __sence__ of entitlement that she is protecting not marriage . __s1__ may -lrb- or may not -rrb- can show harm in another sense , but __s1__ certainly have not shown how __s1__ 's religious rights are taken away or harmed , to begin with . that 's the point . __s1__ certainly have not shown how her definition infringes upon __s1__ 's religious freedom -- __s1__ are still free to be just as religious in practice and belief as ever if __musgrave__ 's views became law . __s1__ are trying to use a religious freedom argument here and it just does n't fit . yes __s1__ have . have n't s2 been __poaying__ attention ? -rsb- because it is her religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman . __s1__ 's religious belief is that marriage is between two people that love each other regardless of sex . she is tying to place her religious __belif__ into law over mine . who gets hurt here ? if __s1__ 's religious belief is put into law she can still marry the person of her choice . if her religious belief gets put into law she can still marry the person of her choice but __s1__ do not get to . so __s1__ and __s1__ 's people are hurt by __codifing__ her religious belief into law . she is trying to keep gay people out of marriage and thus preserve her heterosexual __privledge__ . ok ! s2 's religious belief says that it 's important to smoke in public __non-smoking__ areas . s2 's religious belief says that it 's important to drive cars as fast as one can on city streets . s2 's religious belief says that the death penalty should never be enforced . gee , this it fun , using religion as an excuse and means to an end to fight legislation ! too bad for __s1__ it does n't work that way . what __s1__ do n't get is that , by __s1__ 's standard , either would be placing one religion over another . the same justification could be made against __s1__ 's view because __s1__ 's view goes against my religious belief . and then if __s1__ say '' but __s1__ 's view causes harm and mine does n't '' then it 's no longer a religious issue so the point is moot to begin with . you missed the point here she is trying to turn her religious belief into law that bars me from from getting married . how is she hurt if it is __s1__ 's religious belief of equal marriage is turned into law ? __s1__ have no idea whether or not she is truly trying to turn her religious belief into law . she may just happen to believe that way religiously , but be pushing for the law because she thinks that 's best for __socety__ . __iow__ , __s1__ have no idea if religion is her real motivation for the law . there 's no way to know or to police someone 's real motivations . __s1__ am part of society and her belief is not in __s1__ 's best __intrest__ . how does __s1__ 's being able to marry a man hurt her in any way ?
ref_sum ->  this is about gay marriage . __s1__ seems to believe that someone is making religion into law by saying marriage should be between a heterosexual couple . s2 is arguing that __s1__ 's point is not very valid because __s1__ is not understanding that they are not using the persons perspective . __s1__ believes that that person is trying to hurt them , while s2 is saying that the person may not necessarily be that way and that the person may be arguing for what they believe to be greater for society , based on their own perspective . __s1__ 's religious view of marriage is based on two people 's love for each other , while the other person believes its between a man and woman . s2 says __s1__ 's argument is empty and that __s1__ is not showing how the other person is being hurt by gay marriage . s2 thinks __s1__ is not understanding the overall perspectives and just focusing on their own needs . __s1__ states that the person 's religion put into law affects peoples ability to marry if they are gay , but that __s1__ 's religion on marriage put into law would not affect marriage for anyone .
generated -> the law that will bar s1 's family from legal protections . it wo n't protect her marriage but will bar me and s1 's people from being full citizens . she is trying to keep gay people out of marriage and thus preserve her heterosexual privledge that

Article ->  __lesz__ , __s1__ 's marriage means a great many things to me , none of which have anything to do with our governments . __s1__ 's question to s2 is what do __s1__ think marriage should mean to our governments ? well , marriage is an ancient human institution , based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans , and is one of the foundations of social stability . why would it surprise anyone that government might wish to support it ? what really surprises me is to find how many alleged christians now find it __expedient__ to demand government '' get out of marriage '' , simply because gay people want to get in it . bunch of hypocrites -- they never complained about government regulating marriage before this . now , while s2 agree it is n't absolutely essential for government to be involved in the regulation and support of marriage , it is nevertheless a convenience that few people would really want to throw away . -lrb- mr. __writela__ has summed it up eloquently so s2 need n't elaborate . -rrb- alas , many are just too mean-spirited to share marriage with those pesky __homos__ , so they have jumped on the __get-out-of-marriage__ bandwagon -- which is n't going to go anywhere -- as camouflage for their real feelings . that government would wish to be involved in any aspect of our lives , would not surprise me . that is what governments tend to do . consider the '' healthy marriage initiative '' . this is our government and as citizens , we would be well advised to exercise vigilance to prevent our government from __intruding__ into areas where there is no necessity . just because a few mean-spirited hypocrites may advocate that the government get out of marriage for the wrong reasons does not mean that the idea is all bad . never happen ? enlist the 100 single people who have the biggest stake in this issue and chip away at the exclusive benefits . start with an easy one like hospital visitation and work up to the tough ones like social security to spouses why ? why is it in the interests of society to prevent government involvement in marriage ? that 's what __s1__ have n't explained . __mrwritela__ pointed out the reasons that government involvement is pretty much unavoidable , if only because government is the source of law . it seems to me __s1__ advocate the replacement of marriage with a plethora of minor and specific legal contracts that would only benefit the lawyers writing them . it 's the wood and the trees . if specific laws are trees , then marriage is the forest that protects our relationships from such gales that xxxx . is there any specific advantage to looking to individual trees and ignoring the wood ? __lesz__ __s1__ ask why and s2 ask why not . why should government get out of the marriage business 1 . it is not needed 2 . the current marriage benefits are terribly unfair to single people that are forced to pay for them . __s1__ 's __eloquence__ notwithstanding , have found it useful to look very closely at the trees when solving problems . would suggest that one can not understand the wood unless one knows something about trees . also , have often found it useful to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller parts and solving the easiest parts first . why is government support of marriage unfair to single people ? single people do not have the same issues as married people . having been married and single myself , s2 do have some insight here . and why would rather married people go to lawyers for multiple legal contracts to cover all the hundreds of rights and mutual obligations currently conferred by marriage ? are a lawyer in need of clients ? __;-rrb-__ s2 's own experience of woods and trees is that there is no value in looking at them in only one way . one needs to consider them as trees and woods . __s1__ have also been single and married . experience but not much insight . __s1__ would be interested to hear s2 's views about this difference in issues and how these issues are helped by government involvement . __lesz__ , __s1__ am an engineer , not a lawyer . well , single people live by themselves , not as a family . by definition , they do not have a significant relationship -- and no , s2 do n't count boyfriends or girlfriends here , s2 am referring to committed couples who live together as a family unit . there are many legal issues such as inheritance , pension and social security rights , adoption and child custody , home ownership , etc. , which would need separate legal contracts without the umbrella of marriage . -lrb- and of course , even then such contracts would only be enforceable by government . -rrb- s2 myself had tremendous difficulties sorting out property issues with s2 's partner 's family after he died . it all but __bankrupted__ me , and there would n't have been any issue at all had it been legal for us to get married . we did have some legal contracts pertaining to the house , and wills , but alas they were n't good enough to get his family off s2 's back , because our legal relationship was trumped by his familial one . s2 am not saying it could n't be done piecemeal , tailor-made to suit each individual couple , but would n't that be excessively inconvenient -- for everyone but the lawyers ? whereas at __prresent__ , when __s1__ get married for a $ 25 license , hey presto , __s1__ get those protections and the lawyers have to defer their caribbean cruise .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are debating the topic of what marriage should mean to our government . __s1__ believes it is not a bad idea because they think it is not necessary for the government to be involved in most aspects of our lives , while s2 is questioning why it 's necessary to try and remove government involvement when it is unavoidable . __s1__ brings up that because several people are against the government due to gay marriage and not because it 's just marriage altogether , it does n't mean it 's not a bad idea to remove government intervention . __s1__ mentions the `` healthy marriage initiative '' and how it is n't necessary . s2 says that there is too much legal work and documents behind marriage in the government , such as inheritance , pension and social rights , etc. . , and that it would be a lot more work if the government did n't intervene , also stating that removing marriage from government will only benefit lawyers . both __s1__ and s2 have had experience with marriage , s2 states that marriage benefits are good because of government intervention .
generated -> marriage '' an ancient human institution , based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans , and is one of the foundations of social stability that alas , many are just too mean-spirited to share marriage with those pesky homos , so they have jumped on the get-out-of-marriage bandwagon . why is it in the interests of society to prevent government involvement in marriage ? that

Article ->  in the sense that saying one supports gay rights but not gay marriage , sure . but __s1__ have no problem with that inconsistency . however , s2 are for gay marriage , __ergo__ , it makes more sense s2 had be bothered by that inconsistency . but if not , fine . whatever ... -lrb- and yes , __s1__ know s2 have given me s2 's ' reasons ' . does n't mean there 's no inconsistency there . it just means s2 think it 's not something that should be challenged right now . -rrb- again , s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't understand why __s1__ keep saying it 's an '' inconsistency '' . it 's not a matter of it being a '' problem '' , but rather a question of why __s1__ repeatedly label it as an '' inconsistency '' . just to try to put this plainly . __s1__ and biden have both stated the same opinion . against gay marriage , but for gay rights in every other way . with __s1__ 's stated opinion statement , s2 do n't see an inconsistency . but __s1__ do see an inconsistency with __s1__ 's stated opinion statement . quite frankly , s2 really have n't seen __s1__ show an inconsistency yet . __s1__ have said '' inconsistency '' , but not show it . it 's a bit like saying '' frank is inconsistent on the abortion issue '' , but that 's it . it would be showing an inconsistency to show frank 's statement saying '' s2 am against all abortion '' , but then he has no problem with his wife getting an abortion cause she does n't want to lose her figure . nothing in his statement is '' inconsistent '' , __imo__ . if __s1__ say biden is '' inconsistent '' , __s1__ are also saying that about __s1__ 's position ... s2 know , if s2 are n't able to grasp the concept of the inconsistency of saying one is against gay marriage when saying they are for gay rights , __s1__ do n't know what else to say . it would be different if s2 did n't think gay marriage should be a right . but s2 do , so how could his position not be inconsistent to you ? to take s2 's abortion example , it would be like someone saying they are for reproductive / abortion rights , but yet being against it being legal for women to get an abortion at an abortion clinic . frankly , s2 are grasping at straws at this point . but that 's your position ... if __s1__ ca n't grasp that __s1__ are saying your own position is inconsistent , s2 do n't know what to say . yeah . __s1__ have no recollection of what s2 's position actually is , do you . as s2 have already explained to you , s2 see that a person can be for gay rights and against gay marriage . s2 see that a person can propose a compromise , that s2 personally would find acceptable . s2 ca n't tell __s1__ how many people have posted '' s2 do n't believe gay marriage is a right '' . if they also say '' s2 believe gays should have equal rights '' , there is no contradiction just cause s2 believe -lrb- let me repeat that , s2 believe -rrb- that gay marriage is a right . s2 think biden 's wrong . but his view is consistent . on another note , s2 am just amazed that __s1__ think __s1__ 's own position is inconsistent . s2 honestly had no idea ... are s2 just not reading the thread __????__ apparently not . let me repeat myself ... '' in the sense that saying one supports gay rights but not gay marriage , sure . '' __s1__ have already said __s1__ know it 's inconsistent , but that __s1__ do n't care . it 's not a pet issue for me . it is for you . yet s2 are far more concerned , it seems , about the inconsistency on __s1__ 's part than on biden 's part . yet it 's biden who 's s2 's candidate . stop the dishonesty of pretending __s1__ have n't already addressed that . actually , s2 did n't think __s1__ had recognized what __s1__ had admitted . next sentence __s1__ talked about biden ... '' more concerned '' ? s2 am arguing against the general position . it does n't matter who holds it . one of the points with biden , as explained in multiple points before , is how the perception of holding his feet to the fire could impact others ... if s2 could have a private one-on-one with biden , or if he logged on anonymously to this __web-site__ , s2 would discuss it with him just the same . quite frankly , the '' he 's our candidate '' thing is one of the things that takes precedent . see , we do n't approach these things as '' single issue '' type guys . we weigh the '' gay marriage opinion '' up against the impact of pushing him hard on it a few weeks away from election day , and balance the responding approach accordingly . s2 hear somewhere that '' single issue '' guys can be frowned upon . that ai n't us ...
ref_sum ->  it seems like they are discussing the inconsistency of each other 's arguments . __s1__ is getting annoyed and seems to just be arguing because they are `` venting '' while s2 is saying that the inconsistency is present and making all arguments invalid without proof . both __s1__ and s2 are for gay rights , s2 is stating that __s1__ is n't being consistent and `` admits '' to being inconsistent , while __s1__ is saying they do n't care about the inconsistency because of the point they are trying to get across . they bring up biden and abortion in ways that dont exactly fit the discussion , but just to show the inconsistency in each others opinions . s2 is saying they would handle this same situation with biden the exact same way because s2 is simply talking about perspective . __s1__ believes s2 is stating that __s1__ believes in gay marriage but not gay rights , which seems contradictory to __s1__ 's point . this argument does not have a set topic .
generated -> again , s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't mean there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency .

Article ->  __s1__ wish . but however much __s1__ disagree with sullivan on many political issues , he 's right about that . the world did change when the mass. legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights . it may be a big change in a small state , but it is a recognition that the winds of change are blowing against homophobic bigotry . __s1__ are just going to have to get over it . the world just is n't as anti-gay as it used to be . and that means that __s1__ are going to have to accept equal rights eventually , as gay marriage . presumably __s1__ will hope than in a few years , bigots in massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality . __s1__ think you 'll be out of luck . __s1__ wish that s2 wish . do __s1__ just like to argue for the sake of being argumentative ? __s1__ have picked out the one single thing s2 said there that __s1__ could disagree with and are making an issue of it , not even willing to agree on anything else s2 said . but fine , go ahead and think this is some __world-changing__ event if it makes __s1__ feel better . well , clearly __s1__ did n't even read s2 's post . -lrb- shrug -rrb- s2 have often posted here that s2 oppose gay marriage . that means s2 oppose equal rights for gays . if s2 have changed s2 's mind , and hope that massachusetts does n't overturn gay marriage , s2 would have said so . since s2 did n't , s2 do n't . no , __s1__ said __s1__ s2 '' will hope than in a few years , bigots in massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality '' . s2 had said , very plainly , that s2 think such legislation is an __over-intrusion__ by the government . clearly __s1__ did n't read s2 's post . are s2 claiming now s2 are in favour of legal marriage for gays in massachusetts now the legislature has voted for it ? because if so , that would be a change . s2 is saying that s2 would not want an amendment put in place banning it , because that would be an __over-intrusion__ into peoples ' lives by the government . so naturally , s2 would n't want such an amendment voted into creation , either , and that 's why s2 took issue with __s1__ 's claim that s2 would . that 's been s2 's position here for as long as s2 remember . and it 's a true conservative position -lrb- as opposed to __neocon__ -rrb- , __btw__ . are s2 saying that s2 are not in favour of a government ban on gay marriage ? s2 oppose doma laws ? does that mean s2 are now , contrary to s2 's previous posts , in favour of legal recognition of gay marriage ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing a legislative action associated with a massachusetts court ruling which is favorable to gay rights . __s1__ is enthusiastic about the matter and sees it as a step in the right direction against bigotry , and a recognition that the world is not as anti-gay as it used to be , which s2 is advised to acknowledge and accept . __s1__ also accuses s2 of being inconsistent in having been on the record on the website opposing gay marriage -lrb- and !!__therefor__!! according to __s1__ being opposed to equal rights for gays -rrb- , but now also taking a position that the state should not intervene to ban gay marriage . s2 defends that position and argues it is based on conservative principles against intrusions into individual lives .
generated -> the world did change when the mass. legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights . it may be a big change in a small state , but it may be a big change in a small state , but it is a recognition that the winds of change are blowing against homophobic bigotry .

Article ->  we do n't just benefit from what is often considered the common , nuclear family . we benefit from families with adopted children , step children , families with no children at all . no it does not . prove it will come up , and also prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . marriage is that now . s2 are right , it has nothing to do with the bible . it has everything to do with the slippery slope logical __fallacy__ , which we have discussed in the forum ad __nauseum__ . it only shows that those opposed do not have an argument . s2 know the prospect of incest and polygamy is much less socially acceptable than gay marriage , so s2 try to erroneously tie polygamy and incest to gay marriage in people 's mind to strike fear in them , and hope their logical reasoning can be replaced by irrational fear . a married couple as the head of a home is considered a nuclear family it already has . the question of legality is what this whole issue is about . marriage is a legal __instituation__ , how could legality not come up . yes it is whoa ... hold up ... are __s1__ saying that only because gay marriage is less unacceptable that incestuous relations , that its ok to grant gay marriage but not sibling marriage ?? if the incestuous society begin to parade and protest , until society accepts them on the level that they accept gays now , what will __s1__ say then ? on what grounds should we discriminate against 2 siblings wanting to get married , particularly if they believe they truly love each other , or if they believe that they were born with that attraction ? this is classic __hypocracy__ . if 2 siblings want to love each other in their private lives , how is that any business of yours ? and what does irrational fear have to do with anything ? do __s1__ have an irrational fear of an incestuous or polygamous lifestyle ? based on what ? give me one reason why society __shouldnt__ accept an incestuous relation between two consenting adults then what may lead to incest and polygamy is the fact that marriage is a legal institution , is that what s2 are saying ? if so , these things may come up equally as a result of straight legal marriage or gay legal marriage or interracial legal marriage , or legal __inter-faith__ marriage or legal marriage with legal divorce , etc. . it does n't relate specifically to gay legal marriage at all . __s1__ was saying this is how many people attempt an argument against gay marriage , by attempting to incite fear by spouting off a parade of __horribles__ that have nothing to do with the issue of gay marriage . what if straight people are married and winged green monkeys come flying out of everyone 's derriere in the future ? what will s2 do then ? demonstrate how gay marriage specifically relates to incest and incestuous marriage and polygamy . this is the gay rights forum , not the incest forum . thats not what im saying . what may lead to incestuous marriage is if siblings or related people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . and what may lead to polygamous marriage is 3 or more people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . do __s1__ see a pattern here ? __ooooh__ . . nice way to snake out of the issue ... let me refresh __s1__ 's memory since __s1__ brought it up , what exactly does the social acceptance of any type of '' taboo '' relationship have to do with their right to be legally married ? is there a certain limit of '' __tabooness__ '' , and if __youre__ past that limit then no marriage for you ? and what fear are __s1__ talking about ? s2 is talking about people that love each other and want to tie the knot . how could that possibly strike fear in somebody ? please ... . yes , that 's true . yes , that 's true . are s2 saying love is the pattern ? well , love applies to straight marriages as well as gay marriages . love is not exclusive to gay marriages . if that 's the connection , we can just as easily say straight marriage will lead to incestuous marriage and polygamy . s2 are saying love will cause a slippery slope . it 's still __fallacious__ . the issue __s1__ brought up was why this __fallacy__ is often used , that is to create fear , because incest and polygamy are indeed considered so taboo . the issue is not the __tabooness__ of anything and everything , but how it is being used to distract from the issue of same-sex marriage , when there is n't a logical , rational argument against same-sex marriage . it 's an indication of desperation on the part of some of those who are against same-sex marriage . __s1__ have no reason to discuss the level of __acceptability__ or lack thereof of every single thing , before __s1__ accept one thing that is different from all those other things . __s1__ can deal with that one thing on all of its own merits and shortfalls , without being drawn into a false dilemma , either accept everything or else do n't accept one thing , as if those are the only two choices , __fallacy__ . gay marriage will change the definition of marriage from '' a legal union between a man and a woman '' to '' a legal union between any parties that love each other '' . if its ok for 2 people that love each other and want to tie the knot , then how could incest be a taboo ? based on what ? again with the double standard . gay marriage was considered just as much a taboo as incest or polygamy just a few years ago . being gay emerged from its taboo status through parades , promotional efforts , and , unfortunately , by spreading lies -lrb- i 'll deal with that in another thread -rrb- . however , incestuous people __didnt__ go through the process of parading their lifestyle in front of the world and practically begging for approval from society . so incest is still deeper in taboo status than homosexuality . why is it ok to deny incestuous relations the right to marry on the grounds that it is considered taboo , but ok to approve gay marriage on the same grounds ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are debating whether making gay marriage legal will open opportunities for other `` taboos '' in our society . __s1__ believes that in opening this opportunity for gay marriage , the definition of marriage will change and it will allow other issues like incest and polygamy to become legal . s2 accuses __s1__ of __hypocracy__ . in a sense , they believe gay marriage will have a sort of domino effect for other issues . __s1__ is arguing that using these other issues to be evidence for why !!__gay-marriage__!! should n't be allowed is not a valid argument . then __s1__ goes on to say that this tactic is used to instill fear to those who do not support those other issues . __s1__ understands the other issues , but does n't see the relationship between those and that of same-sex marriage . s2 keeps arguing that it __shouldnt__ be different figuring out whether one can approve gay marriage but not incest since they believe the two to be somewhat related .
generated -> prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . marriage is that now , and prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . it has everything to do with the slippery slope logical fallacy , which we have discussed in the forum ad nauseum .

Article ->  matt , this is getting ridiculous . s2 made an assertion that republicans would send gays to concentration camps like the germans did in the holocaust . then s2 brought up a statement by paul cameron , as if paul cameron has anything to do whatsoever with republican politics or leadership . now if s2 had linked someone in the republican leadership saying those things , s2 might have something , but s2 did n't . paul cameron is a psychologist that has gone over the top at times with some of the things he 's said about gays and has paid a price for it . he 's a frequent target of the gay pride movement for __demonization__ and because he did n't tow the line with the apa 's political stances , they distanced themselves from him . __s1__ do n't agree with everything he says either , for that matter . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking ; the most s2 can say is that they are paul cameron talking . well , sure -- anything could happen . a military coup could take place and we had have martial law . a new ice age could start in the next year . an asteroid could be on its way to hit earth . but there 's a big difference between possibility and likelihood . paul cameron is the single most frequently quoted '' expert '' cited by the gop in all their attempts to limit the rights of gay people . his '' research '' has been entered in the congressional record countless times . it really is astounding that anyone would have anything to do with him . including you . what price ? without his revolting beliefs and __star-power__ , he had be flipping burgers somewhere . instead , he 's raking in a fortune speaking to the '' moral '' groups __s1__ are constantly defending . he was dismissed from the group for conducting fraudulent research . cameron talking ... gop repeating . seriously , __jyoshu__ , the man called for extermination . how can __s1__ support him or cite him or defend him at all __??????__ how can s2 not stay on point ? unless cameron is a part of the gop __leadeship__ , matt is pulling some wild point out of his hat , saying that because someone who may not even be a republican hates gays , that republicans hate gays . __s1__ might as well have said that since john lennon attacked religion , then democrats hate religion . yes , his comments are that ludicrous . this is not about paul cameron no matter how much s2 had love to change the subject , it 's about matt 's ridiculous __generalizations__ and comments . oh , and s2 need to get up with the times -- no national political party has used cameron 's information in a serious way in a long time . __s1__ is sure you 'll now be googling to try and find republican individuals out there on the internet citing cameron , but that 's not the party leadership or its platform . there is no republican in leadership that would call for the extermination of gays , and s2 know it . nor does the platform say so . so let 's put that little lie to bed right now . sorry , sir . since __s1__ did n't stay on point , s2 thought others were just as free to wander . if democratic legislators from sea to shining sea quoted lennon 's lyrics about '' imagine no religion '' at every session that talked about religious freedom , __s1__ might draw that conclusion , no ? __ooops__ . s2 thought it was about a conservative democrat in minnesota bragging about '' inside information '' from that state 's supreme court . uh ... how about the president of the united states ??? paul cameron 's research is cited in virtually every single attack on gay people in state after state after state legislature . it was presented in the '' debate '' about same-sex marriage in the u.s. __friggin__ ' senate . his name appears in the citations of virtually every legal brief filed by opponents of same-sex marriage . __http__ think he even made it into lawrence v. texas . the man is president of the family research institute . he can probably phone up ol ' __dubya__ anytime he gets the urge . and __dubya__ will put down his pretzel and pick up the phone . what should be put to bed is paul cameron and every single bogus study related to him . that supposedly reasonable people would even mention his name is surprising . ok , __s1__ now realize something __s1__ did n't earlier -- that __http__ are obviously a dnc __shill__ . no one else would make such a ridiculous __generalization__ . __http__ really do think that 's all conservatives talk about , huh ? __s1__ hate to bust __http__ 's bubble , but it 's not . __s1__ know __http__ 's martyr complex is important to you , but it 's just not accurate . -lrb- shrug -rrb- what are __s1__ talking about ? s2 said __s1__ had probably be right to assume that some people were __anti-religion__ if they consistently talked about what a wonderful world it would be without it ? over and over . at every opportunity . and never had a single nice word to say about it . ever . __s1__ really are laughable when __s1__ try to defend the gop when one of their admittedly most effective propaganda campaigns is to rally the '' __family-values__ '' crowd against gay rights . it 's openly admitted by them . they are proud of their tactics . very odd ...
ref_sum ->  this seems to be an argument about gay rights and !!__generalizing__!! the political beliefs of people . according to __s1__ , s2 talks about paul cameron and makes it seem as if he is the voice of the republicans . __s1__ argues that it is not the case and one person who sides with a specific party does n't represent the party . __s1__ uses john lennon as an example of this not being a proper way to !!__generalize__!! political views of parties , in his case the democratic party . __s1__ accuses s2 of making an assertion including the republicans creating another holocaust , because of the !!__generalization__!! that s2 made . s2 believes that paul cameron 's views are cited and used in many cases against gay rights because most people do share the same views , which __s1__ thinks otherwise . s2 says that most attacks on gay rights have cited paul cameron , even within the us senate , showing that he has a strong opinion in the republican party , or at least it seems so .

ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that his opposition to gay marriage is based on the belief that it will hurt more people than it helps , not on bigotry . he suggests that it would hurt people with a traditional view of marriage as between a man and a woman , and that the benefits of marriage can be gained by homosexuals without redefining marriage . s2 argues that gay marriage does not hurt anyone , straight or gay , and offending proponents of traditional marriage is not a valid argument against it . he believes that preventing gay marriage is simply faith based hate . he claims that having separate rules for straight and gay marriage creates the possibility of those rules being different for the two groups , allowing the gay minority to be disenfranchised .

ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that it is inappropriate to label disagreement as bigotry , and that while someone might think an argument is bigoted , it may be motivated by something other than bigotry . he argues that many people 's opinions are based on their view of marriage , not their dislike of homosexuals , and that they would be against any group wanting to alter the traditional view of marriage . s2 claims that opponents of gay rights are discriminatory and bigoted . he suggests that if you replaced gays with another minority , then the arguments against them would appear negative -lrb- e. g. , trying to exclude any other minority from getting married would not be acceptable -rrb- . he believes that opponents of gay marriage are not protecting traditional marriage , but are discriminating against homosexuals .

'' because __s1__ am only concerned with rights of gay people . gay people are __s1__ 's first concern . this evil woman should come out and __sayshe__ is anti gay . she should come out and say she does n't want gay people to get married . she should admit that she wants gay people to remain second class citizens . why does n't she own up to her discrimination ? she wants to protect her heterosexual __privledge__ . for the record __s1__ own that statement and stand behind it . __s1__ will talk people out of attending these bible churches . __s1__ will do what __s1__ can to legally disrupt any __rundrasining__ activities they have going . __s1__ will protest their wedding ceremonies . __s1__ will protest their church services . as far as __s1__ am concerned , once they crossed over the line and started pushing for and getting laws enacted that hurt me , __s1__ 's family , __ands__ __s1__ 's people , they have no place in society . and __s1__ have yet to show why this is not a legitimate viewpoint , nor a legitimate way to legislate this issue . it 's obvious that all __s1__ care about is gay people . however , __s1__ have not shown why anti-gay -lrb- as __s1__ call them -rrb- people should not be able to legislate their view . all __s1__ have said is that __s1__ do n't like their view . big deal , they do n't like __s1__ 's view either . thus , in a democracy like ours , the majority of people decide issues like this . besides that , s2 think coming out in support of a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage qualifies as '' com -lsb- ing -rsb- out and say -lsb- ing -rsb- that she does n't want gay people to get married . '' this is fine . but also understand that it is legitimate for people who believe like ms. __musgrave__ to do the same , including to use the democratic process to have her view enacted in law . if __s1__ are free to do it , then she is as well . should the majority have the right to __enslave__ their fellow citizens ? should the majority have the right to lock people up in concentration camps ? a majority of the people in the us once thought it was a good idea . oh __s1__ want the evil woman to say it . __s1__ want her __viciousness__ and ugliness out in the open . if she is anti gay then she needs to own up to her bigotry repent america believes in protesting and disrupting gay gatherings . why if they can do this __s1__ can do the same . the majority did have the legal right -lrb- unfortunately -rrb- to __enslave__ their fellow citizens until the 13 th amendment took that option off the table . incidentally , it took a majority of people to take slavery off of the table . in the united states , the majority wins -lrb- for good or for ill -rrb- . s2 hope __s1__ are not trying to make a comparison between the denial of marriage to gays -lrb- and to 10 year olds , and to those who are currently married yet want another husband / wife , and to those who wish to marry their father , etc. -rrb- on the one hand , and slavery and / or concentration camps on the other . ok , and what would that accomplish ? yeah , that 's exactly what s2 said .

Article ->  because it 's all quite clear . decades of effort from the religious right , conservative republicans , and their like have made gay rights a poisoned topic . it 's a tragedy , but saying the right thing on this issue will cost s2 more votes than it will gain you , everyone knows it , and no one is going to do it . it 's politics 101 . the democrats , as a whole , want to do the right thing , but they know that if they say so too loudly they wo n't be in a position to do anything . they are forced to moderate their public stances so that they can get into positions where they can actually take action . this is of course a __generalization__ , but if s2 are talking about a political party as a whole that 's unavoidable . so , __s1__ are basically saying that biden was lying through his teeth when he said he does n't support gay marriage ? it was all just a lie to keep from losing votes ? interesting . possibly , __s1__ could n't say . certainly as a democrat he gets more benefit of the doubt than __s1__ would give a republican when it comes to gay rights , but __s1__ have n't __plumbed__ his record enough to say for sure . and let 's be honest here , s2 do not find the idea that a politician might be lying interesting . what s2 had prefer is that the candidates be honest about their views , whether it 's popular or unpopular . but even knowing we are talking about political candidates -lrb- who may lie to get votes -rrb- , when a candidate says something is his or her view , s2 think we have to take them at what they say when they answer a question like that so directly and emphatically . otherwise , there 's little point in asking questions to begin with other than maybe watching the reaction of body language and how they would respond under pressure , and so forth . political discourse has to operate to where when a candidate gives a given view as his or her view , they are taken at their word that is their view . '' no '' ca n't mean '' yes '' and so forth . no , that 's too __niave__ an approach . we know politicians are going to tell some lies , __s1__ trust that 's a given . we , as political consumers , ca n't simply take politicians at their word . if we want to make informed decisions about candidates we need to develop the skills to make useful judgement calls about what they are saying . we need to figure out how often they lie , what they lie about , how big their lies are . obviously we should n't need to do this , it would be great if we could actually take our politicians at their word . bad the sad reality is that we ca n't , not at this stage anyway . in this particular case , if biden says he does n't support gay marriage __s1__ is just as likely to think it 's because he knows that open support could cost him the white house as any other reason . it 's sad that such double speak is needed , __s1__ had love it if enough courageous politicians stood forth and ended the political need for lies , but until that wonderful day __s1__ is not going to be naive and take everything they say at their word , nor am __s1__ going to jump up and down and point fingers at every __falsehood__ . i 'll try to judge the politicians by their actions , and their lies by their magnitude , scope , and quantity . s2 think __s1__ are misunderstanding me -- s2 do n't mean s2 think we should assume they are going to always tell the truth -- s2 mean we should put the expectation on them to be honest . __iow__ , honesty is what we should demand . if we are n't even going to do that , there 's no point in ever asking a political candidate a direct question . knowing they are going to lie is n't the same as having the expectation on them to be honest . s2 really do n't think it 's too much to ask our candidates to say what their views are . __s1__ just said yourself '' we need to figure out how often they lie , what they lie about , how big their lies are '' so , obviously , __s1__ believe it 's not really good that they are lying . there would be little point in asking them questions if we are n't going to hold to them to some level of expectation that they are going to say what they mean . sure , they lie , but if the words of politicians mean nothing , there 's little point in even having political discourse . political cynicism is no excuse to not put expectations on our candidates to be honest with the american people .
ref_sum ->  this is about politics and whether or not the lie in order to get more votes . __s1__ believes politicians sometimes may lie as long as its what is the majority , while s2 is saying that s2 is more concerned with the honesty of the candidates rather than whether they are lying or not . s2 says we should expect them to be honest , because that is what we should want from politicians . __s1__ argues that politicians seem to lie in order to get the position they want or sway people to become popular , while s2 thinks that we should rely on them to make the right decision . __s1__ seems to think that s2 is making an argument for their belief , but s2 is just trying to be honest and show the other perspective . they argue about politicians lying through discussing when politicians are asked questions and how they answer them . s2 finishes by telling __s1__ we should not label politicians and expect them to do and say the right , honest thing .
generated -> conservative republicans say the right thing on this issue will cost s2 more votes than it will gain you , everyone knows it , and no one is going to do it . it 's politics 101 , but if s2 are talking about a political party as a whole that 's unavoidable . so , s1 are basically saying that biden was lying through his teeth when he said he does n't support gay marriage ?

Article ->  __lesz__ , __s1__ 's marriage means a great many things to me , none of which have anything to do with our governments . __s1__ 's question to s2 is what do __s1__ think marriage should mean to our governments ? well , marriage is an ancient human institution , based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans , and is one of the foundations of social stability . why would it surprise anyone that government might wish to support it ? what really surprises me is to find how many alleged christians now find it __expedient__ to demand government '' get out of marriage '' , simply because gay people want to get in it . bunch of hypocrites -- they never complained about government regulating marriage before this . now , while s2 agree it is n't absolutely essential for government to be involved in the regulation and support of marriage , it is nevertheless a convenience that few people would really want to throw away . -lrb- mr. __writela__ has summed it up eloquently so s2 need n't elaborate . -rrb- alas , many are just too mean-spirited to share marriage with those pesky __homos__ , so they have jumped on the __get-out-of-marriage__ bandwagon -- which is n't going to go anywhere -- as camouflage for their real feelings . that government would wish to be involved in any aspect of our lives , would not surprise me . that is what governments tend to do . consider the '' healthy marriage initiative '' . this is our government and as citizens , we would be well advised to exercise vigilance to prevent our government from __intruding__ into areas where there is no necessity . just because a few mean-spirited hypocrites may advocate that the government get out of marriage for the wrong reasons does not mean that the idea is all bad . never happen ? enlist the 100 single people who have the biggest stake in this issue and chip away at the exclusive benefits . start with an easy one like hospital visitation and work up to the tough ones like social security to spouses why ? why is it in the interests of society to prevent government involvement in marriage ? that 's what __s1__ have n't explained . __mrwritela__ pointed out the reasons that government involvement is pretty much unavoidable , if only because government is the source of law . it seems to me __s1__ advocate the replacement of marriage with a plethora of minor and specific legal contracts that would only benefit the lawyers writing them . it 's the wood and the trees . if specific laws are trees , then marriage is the forest that protects our relationships from such gales that xxxx . is there any specific advantage to looking to individual trees and ignoring the wood ? __lesz__ __s1__ ask why and s2 ask why not . why should government get out of the marriage business 1 . it is not needed 2 . the current marriage benefits are terribly unfair to single people that are forced to pay for them . __s1__ 's __eloquence__ notwithstanding , have found it useful to look very closely at the trees when solving problems . would suggest that one can not understand the wood unless one knows something about trees . also , have often found it useful to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller parts and solving the easiest parts first . why is government support of marriage unfair to single people ? single people do not have the same issues as married people . having been married and single myself , s2 do have some insight here . and why would rather married people go to lawyers for multiple legal contracts to cover all the hundreds of rights and mutual obligations currently conferred by marriage ? are a lawyer in need of clients ? __;-rrb-__ s2 's own experience of woods and trees is that there is no value in looking at them in only one way . one needs to consider them as trees and woods . __s1__ have also been single and married . experience but not much insight . __s1__ would be interested to hear s2 's views about this difference in issues and how these issues are helped by government involvement . __lesz__ , __s1__ am an engineer , not a lawyer . well , single people live by themselves , not as a family . by definition , they do not have a significant relationship -- and no , s2 do n't count boyfriends or girlfriends here , s2 am referring to committed couples who live together as a family unit . there are many legal issues such as inheritance , pension and social security rights , adoption and child custody , home ownership , etc. , which would need separate legal contracts without the umbrella of marriage . -lrb- and of course , even then such contracts would only be enforceable by government . -rrb- s2 myself had tremendous difficulties sorting out property issues with s2 's partner 's family after he died . it all but __bankrupted__ me , and there would n't have been any issue at all had it been legal for us to get married . we did have some legal contracts pertaining to the house , and wills , but alas they were n't good enough to get his family off s2 's back , because our legal relationship was trumped by his familial one . s2 am not saying it could n't be done piecemeal , tailor-made to suit each individual couple , but would n't that be excessively inconvenient -- for everyone but the lawyers ? whereas at __prresent__ , when __s1__ get married for a $ 25 license , hey presto , __s1__ get those protections and the lawyers have to defer their caribbean cruise .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are debating the topic of what marriage should mean to our government . __s1__ believes it is not a bad idea because they think it is not necessary for the government to be involved in most aspects of our lives , while s2 is questioning why it 's necessary to try and remove government involvement when it is unavoidable . __s1__ brings up that because several people are against the government due to gay marriage and not because it 's just marriage altogether , it does n't mean it 's not a bad idea to remove government intervention . __s1__ mentions the `` healthy marriage initiative '' and how it is n't necessary . s2 says that there is too much legal work and documents behind marriage in the government , such as inheritance , pension and social rights , etc. . , and that it would be a lot more work if the government did n't intervene , also stating that removing marriage from government will only benefit lawyers . both __s1__ and s2 have had experience with marriage , s2 states that marriage benefits are good because of government intervention .
generated -> marriage '' an ancient human institution , based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans , and is one of the foundations of social stability that alas , many are just too mean-spirited to share marriage with those pesky homos , so they have jumped on the get-out-of-marriage bandwagon . why is it in the interests of society to prevent government involvement in marriage ? that

Article ->  in the sense that saying one supports gay rights but not gay marriage , sure . but __s1__ have no problem with that inconsistency . however , s2 are for gay marriage , __ergo__ , it makes more sense s2 had be bothered by that inconsistency . but if not , fine . whatever ... -lrb- and yes , __s1__ know s2 have given me s2 's ' reasons ' . does n't mean there 's no inconsistency there . it just means s2 think it 's not something that should be challenged right now . -rrb- again , s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't understand why __s1__ keep saying it 's an '' inconsistency '' . it 's not a matter of it being a '' problem '' , but rather a question of why __s1__ repeatedly label it as an '' inconsistency '' . just to try to put this plainly . __s1__ and biden have both stated the same opinion . against gay marriage , but for gay rights in every other way . with __s1__ 's stated opinion statement , s2 do n't see an inconsistency . but __s1__ do see an inconsistency with __s1__ 's stated opinion statement . quite frankly , s2 really have n't seen __s1__ show an inconsistency yet . __s1__ have said '' inconsistency '' , but not show it . it 's a bit like saying '' frank is inconsistent on the abortion issue '' , but that 's it . it would be showing an inconsistency to show frank 's statement saying '' s2 am against all abortion '' , but then he has no problem with his wife getting an abortion cause she does n't want to lose her figure . nothing in his statement is '' inconsistent '' , __imo__ . if __s1__ say biden is '' inconsistent '' , __s1__ are also saying that about __s1__ 's position ... s2 know , if s2 are n't able to grasp the concept of the inconsistency of saying one is against gay marriage when saying they are for gay rights , __s1__ do n't know what else to say . it would be different if s2 did n't think gay marriage should be a right . but s2 do , so how could his position not be inconsistent to you ? to take s2 's abortion example , it would be like someone saying they are for reproductive / abortion rights , but yet being against it being legal for women to get an abortion at an abortion clinic . frankly , s2 are grasping at straws at this point . but that 's your position ... if __s1__ ca n't grasp that __s1__ are saying your own position is inconsistent , s2 do n't know what to say . yeah . __s1__ have no recollection of what s2 's position actually is , do you . as s2 have already explained to you , s2 see that a person can be for gay rights and against gay marriage . s2 see that a person can propose a compromise , that s2 personally would find acceptable . s2 ca n't tell __s1__ how many people have posted '' s2 do n't believe gay marriage is a right '' . if they also say '' s2 believe gays should have equal rights '' , there is no contradiction just cause s2 believe -lrb- let me repeat that , s2 believe -rrb- that gay marriage is a right . s2 think biden 's wrong . but his view is consistent . on another note , s2 am just amazed that __s1__ think __s1__ 's own position is inconsistent . s2 honestly had no idea ... are s2 just not reading the thread __????__ apparently not . let me repeat myself ... '' in the sense that saying one supports gay rights but not gay marriage , sure . '' __s1__ have already said __s1__ know it 's inconsistent , but that __s1__ do n't care . it 's not a pet issue for me . it is for you . yet s2 are far more concerned , it seems , about the inconsistency on __s1__ 's part than on biden 's part . yet it 's biden who 's s2 's candidate . stop the dishonesty of pretending __s1__ have n't already addressed that . actually , s2 did n't think __s1__ had recognized what __s1__ had admitted . next sentence __s1__ talked about biden ... '' more concerned '' ? s2 am arguing against the general position . it does n't matter who holds it . one of the points with biden , as explained in multiple points before , is how the perception of holding his feet to the fire could impact others ... if s2 could have a private one-on-one with biden , or if he logged on anonymously to this __web-site__ , s2 would discuss it with him just the same . quite frankly , the '' he 's our candidate '' thing is one of the things that takes precedent . see , we do n't approach these things as '' single issue '' type guys . we weigh the '' gay marriage opinion '' up against the impact of pushing him hard on it a few weeks away from election day , and balance the responding approach accordingly . s2 hear somewhere that '' single issue '' guys can be frowned upon . that ai n't us ...
ref_sum ->  it seems like they are discussing the inconsistency of each other 's arguments . __s1__ is getting annoyed and seems to just be arguing because they are `` venting '' while s2 is saying that the inconsistency is present and making all arguments invalid without proof . both __s1__ and s2 are for gay rights , s2 is stating that __s1__ is n't being consistent and `` admits '' to being inconsistent , while __s1__ is saying they do n't care about the inconsistency because of the point they are trying to get across . they bring up biden and abortion in ways that dont exactly fit the discussion , but just to show the inconsistency in each others opinions . s2 is saying they would handle this same situation with biden the exact same way because s2 is simply talking about perspective . __s1__ believes s2 is stating that __s1__ believes in gay marriage but not gay rights , which seems contradictory to __s1__ 's point . this argument does not have a set topic .
generated -> again , s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't mean there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency .

Article ->  because it 's all quite clear . decades of effort from the religious right , conservative republicans , and their like have made gay rights a poisoned topic . it 's a tragedy , but saying the right thing on this issue will cost s2 more votes than it will gain you , everyone knows it , and no one is going to do it . it 's politics 101 . the democrats , as a whole , want to do the right thing , but they know that if they say so too loudly they wo n't be in a position to do anything . they are forced to moderate their public stances so that they can get into positions where they can actually take action . this is of course a __generalization__ , but if s2 are talking about a political party as a whole that 's unavoidable . so , __s1__ are basically saying that biden was lying through his teeth when he said he does n't support gay marriage ? it was all just a lie to keep from losing votes ? interesting . possibly , __s1__ could n't say . certainly as a democrat he gets more benefit of the doubt than __s1__ would give a republican when it comes to gay rights , but __s1__ have n't __plumbed__ his record enough to say for sure . and let 's be honest here , s2 do not find the idea that a politician might be lying interesting . what s2 had prefer is that the candidates be honest about their views , whether it 's popular or unpopular . but even knowing we are talking about political candidates -lrb- who may lie to get votes -rrb- , when a candidate says something is his or her view , s2 think we have to take them at what they say when they answer a question like that so directly and emphatically . otherwise , there 's little point in asking questions to begin with other than maybe watching the reaction of body language and how they would respond under pressure , and so forth . political discourse has to operate to where when a candidate gives a given view as his or her view , they are taken at their word that is their view . '' no '' ca n't mean '' yes '' and so forth . no , that 's too __niave__ an approach . we know politicians are going to tell some lies , __s1__ trust that 's a given . we , as political consumers , ca n't simply take politicians at their word . if we want to make informed decisions about candidates we need to develop the skills to make useful judgement calls about what they are saying . we need to figure out how often they lie , what they lie about , how big their lies are . obviously we should n't need to do this , it would be great if we could actually take our politicians at their word . bad the sad reality is that we ca n't , not at this stage anyway . in this particular case , if biden says he does n't support gay marriage __s1__ is just as likely to think it 's because he knows that open support could cost him the white house as any other reason . it 's sad that such double speak is needed , __s1__ had love it if enough courageous politicians stood forth and ended the political need for lies , but until that wonderful day __s1__ is not going to be naive and take everything they say at their word , nor am __s1__ going to jump up and down and point fingers at every __falsehood__ . i 'll try to judge the politicians by their actions , and their lies by their magnitude , scope , and quantity . s2 think __s1__ are misunderstanding me -- s2 do n't mean s2 think we should assume they are going to always tell the truth -- s2 mean we should put the expectation on them to be honest . __iow__ , honesty is what we should demand . if we are n't even going to do that , there 's no point in ever asking a political candidate a direct question . knowing they are going to lie is n't the same as having the expectation on them to be honest . s2 really do n't think it 's too much to ask our candidates to say what their views are . __s1__ just said yourself '' we need to figure out how often they lie , what they lie about , how big their lies are '' so , obviously , __s1__ believe it 's not really good that they are lying . there would be little point in asking them questions if we are n't going to hold to them to some level of expectation that they are going to say what they mean . sure , they lie , but if the words of politicians mean nothing , there 's little point in even having political discourse . political cynicism is no excuse to not put expectations on our candidates to be honest with the american people .
ref_sum ->  this is about politics and whether or not the lie in order to get more votes . __s1__ believes politicians sometimes may lie as long as its what is the majority , while s2 is saying that s2 is more concerned with the honesty of the candidates rather than whether they are lying or not . s2 says we should expect them to be honest , because that is what we should want from politicians . __s1__ argues that politicians seem to lie in order to get the position they want or sway people to become popular , while s2 thinks that we should rely on them to make the right decision . __s1__ seems to think that s2 is making an argument for their belief , but s2 is just trying to be honest and show the other perspective . they argue about politicians lying through discussing when politicians are asked questions and how they answer them . s2 finishes by telling __s1__ we should not label politicians and expect them to do and say the right , honest thing .
generated -> conservative republicans say the right thing on this issue will cost s2 more votes than it will gain you , everyone knows it , and no one is going to do it . it 's politics 101 , but if s2 are talking about a political party as a whole that 's unavoidable . so , s1 are basically saying that biden was lying through his teeth when he said he does n't support gay marriage ?

ref_sum ->  this debate is about the 9th and how the federal constitution applies to marriage . __s1__ and s2 begin by talking about trolling and potentially starting a new debate on abortion , which does n't really have a lot of purpose in this conversation . s2 says that in saying people who want to get rid of gay marriage may have wanted to prevent __inter-racial__ and inter religious marriage . s2 states that maine 's vote on gay marriage was an opinion on gay marriage , rather than the 9th being how the federal constitution applies to gay marriage . s2 also says that bowers justice stevens does n't have the evidence to withstand his analysis . they also bring up lawrence v. texas and s2 states that even when majority wants a law it is n't enough for the constitution challenge of the law . s2 goes back to saying how __s1__ 's arguments are flawed and that its too repetitive for this conversation , because __s1__ has n't disproved anything . they go back to talking trash to each other and they end the conversation .

Article ->  any two adults can run the household , one can make the decision if the other is incapacitated , one inherits when the other dies , etc etc. . that parallel does not carry over to group marriages . when one dies , who inherits ? if one is __incapacitied__ , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two , so __recongnising__ group marriages is a huge legal task , and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious . if we are talking about legal recognition , and we are -lrb- right ? -rrb- , then the cases are wildly different . our marriage laws , for better or worse , are set up on the assumption of two adults running a household . they also assume man and wife , true , but do n't actually depend on that . but the dependence on there being two people is embedded in the laws ; changing that is a huge project . yes , but gays would also want laws changed to __accomodate__ their form of marriage as well . the fact that one requires less change than the other should n't matter , should it ? should having to do more __reworking__ of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality ? it seems to me __s1__ 's argument boils down to '' polygamy requires more work to make the laws __accomodate__ it . '' yeah -- such is the price for marriage equality . let 's face it -- if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for __opposite-sex__ couples which comprise most relationships , they could pull it off -- polygamy , gays , letting 17 year olds marry , etc. . all those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed . means could be set up to determine inheritance , for example . laws can be worded to do it . see , this is why we try to avoid this debate . those who oppose gay marriage inevitably put their own spin on it and drag it to silly conclusion . here we see what gays really want turned into '' make marriage an open-ended institution of equality '' , which then means gay , poly , and 17 year olds in this case . __jyoshu__ stopped there , but it 's not uncommon for it then to go to children , cousins , dogs , whatever . this issue is not '' let 's let everyone do anything they like '' , that 's just the common __reframing__ we see whenever poly relations are brought up while __disscusing__ gay marriage . it happens all the time , it gets old , and that 's why people who have gone through it a bunch of times tend to __aviod__ the whole thing . it happens because there 's no way to avoid logical conclusions . believe it or not , cultural and legal precedent is a very real thing . the events in the article __exemplify__ this . if __s1__ argue to broaden marriage -lrb- which __s1__ are -rrb- , then this is what __s1__ have to deal with . as __s1__ said , s2 did stop with polygamy , gay , and barely lowering the age of consent , so why are you bringing up all the other examples like '' children , cousins dogs , '' or whatever , as if __s1__ were ready to pounce on that ? __s1__ are arguing against degrees that s2 did n't even say , or that no one said . now , do __s1__ have any response to s2 's point that __s1__ 's argument boils down to nothing more than '' polygamy requires more work to make the laws __accomodate__ it '' , or are __s1__ just going to avoid it by getting __sidetracked__ by the fact __s1__ do n't like that we are even talking about this ? again , society can deal with issues like polygamy if they really want to . sure there is . s2 can start with an erroneous assumption , like s2 did , and then arrive at an illogical conclusion , like s2 did . why do n't s2 read the exchanges between me and phyllis ; __s1__ think most of s2 's issues will be addressed that way . do __s1__ feel that opening marriage to gay couples is not a case of broadening marriage ? how is that an erroneous assumption ? sure , but s2 asked __s1__ some specific questions that __s1__ seem to be avoiding . in __s1__ 's exchange with phyllis s2 may comment on matters s2 disagree with . listen to yourself ! we start with '' gays want to get married '' , s2 change it to '' make marriage an open-ended institution of equality '' , and now s2 __segue__ over to '' broadening marriage '' . s2 's erroneous assumption is s2 's statement of what gays are trying to accomplish . until s2 stop trying to change what gays really want into something that s2 can argue against more easily all s2 's arguments will be based on erroneous assumptions . actually , __s1__ did address them . while debating with phyllis . naturally . and naturally __s1__ may ignore them if __s1__ think they are diversions . what gays are trying or not trying -lrb- in terms of intent -rrb- is not the issue . what is the crux here is that marriage would be broadened . it 's not rocket science . __s1__ are moving the boundaries of what constitutes a marriage to include more than __opposite-sex__ couples . very straightforward . s2 know __s1__ do n't like it __phrased__ that way , but that 's what it is . __s1__ ca n't take a phrase like ' gays want to get married '' without looking at the overall implications . in terms of legal rights , s2 do n't see why it would be any different . equality in marriage is equality in marriage regardless of the cultural motivation -- religious , being in love with more than one person , or simply just for the hell of it . for that matter , the argument could be made that __opposite-sex__ marriage between 2 people is largely a religious construct ! i 'll try to explain this to s2 one more time . the stated purpose of gays is quite __relevent__ if s2 are trying to argue against it . gays want to get married . one side effect of that is that some people will see the scope of marriage broadened . gays are not , in and of itself , trying to broaden marriage . they did not wake up one day and say '' let 's try to broaden the scope of marriage today , that 'll be fun ! '' s2 's arguments run along the lines of '' if s2 want to __braoden__ marriage , than s2 must __excpet__ it broadening in all these other ways '' and that 's why s2 's __rephrasing__ does n't work . broadening marriage is n't the goal , it 's a side effect , and since it is n't the goal we do n't have to accept all these other things s2 claim would be the result if they were trying to broaden marriage . to recap , s2 's arguments are based on s2 's assumption that gays want to broaden marriage , that that is their __ulitmate__ goal , the pinnacle of the cause . gays getting married to s2 seems to be the means to that end . that is , of course , backwards , and so s2 's __sematic__ based arguments fail . __kronos__ , s2 just told __s1__ s2 am not dealing here with what gays are trying / not trying to do in terms of intent , yet __s1__ are are arguing as if s2 never even said that . s2 am not arguing what gays have as intent . s2 completely understand what __s1__ are saying . s2 's point here is based on the effect of their intents , whatever that intent is . there is simply no way to get around the fact that if __s1__ change marriage to include other that __opposite-sex__ couples -lrb- to any number of other possibilities -- even one -rrb- , __s1__ are broadening marriage . whether or not gays set out out to do this in terms of a goal is irrelevant . __s1__ are attacking some point about intent that s2 have n't made -- s2 is talking about the effect here . to latch onto some straw man of '' intent '' is to completely miss the point . __s1__ is not ignoring this post , __s1__ is simply choosing not to respond because it 's a pointless distraction in an otherwise __interesing__ thread . if s2 want to start another thread on this theme i 'll explain there how wrong s2 are . well , __s1__ are the one that 's taking issue and making it a distraction !
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : !!__opposers__!! to gay marriage often jump to conclusions about who can get married - why not cousins , group marriages , children , dogs ? polygamous marriage raises legal concerns that are not currently covered in traditional marriage laws , for example . the goal of gay marriage supporters is to be able to get married - not to broaden marriage . broadened marriage is a side effect of legal gay marriage . s2 : gay marriage supporters want marriage laws changed to accommodate gay marriage . broadened marriage could change the current traditional marriage laws . polygamy , for example , would require more marriage laws changed than gay marriage would , as more people are involved . but if enough people wanted legal polygamous marriage , the laws would be passed . marriage would be broadened if gay marriage is made legal , whether that is the goal of gay marriage or not .
generated -> if one is incapacitied , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that parallel does not carry over to group marriages . if one is incapacitied , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two , so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task , and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious that

Article ->  do n't __s1__ think that in 1909 it was probably viewed mostly from a moral standpoint ? __s1__ do n't think they saw it the same way they would see black people . they did n't even realize that ' homosexuality ' was any sort of innate thing . it was entirely behavioral to them . __s1__ tend to agree with the court , even given what __s1__ have said . __s1__ doubt for 1909 it was about prejudice and bigotry -- they genuinely felt it was wrong . the concept of gay marriage was completely foreign and unknown in 1909 . it was n't even something they conceived of . __s1__ think the court is saying that they could n't have been prejudiced against something they did n't even know of or conceive of . __hogwash__ . it was once entirely moral to believe certain races were inferior , and that women had fewer rights than men . treating the races and women as equal was not something even thought of by many . it was prejudice against gays then , and it still is today . this is not really true . it 's a popular __misconstruing__ of morality and history by proponents of modern ' rights ' movements , but it 's not true . there 's little historical backing to the idea that people believed __oppressing__ black people was a right thing to do , as in , doing good . there were times they used an argument where religion was wrongly used to justify their behavior , but that 's a different matter . if s2 firmly believe otherwise , __s1__ had challenge s2 to show where people thought __oppressing__ blacks was an example if doing good . the same goes for misogyny . furthermore , it 's beside the point anyway . we are talking about homosexuality . in 1909 , the only thing they really understood about the issue at hand was that some people engaged in sexual relations with people of their own gender . there were no articles about '' homosexuality '' as a trait , and certainly none about genetic causes . it was understood entirely from a behavioral standpoint , and therefore a moral standpoint . so it 's not __hogwash__ at all -- they really did view gay sex as immoral . if s2 do n't think so , then s2 have a very poor grasp on history in this case . this kind of morality is based on nothing but ignorance -lrb- which __s1__ admit -rrb- and prejudice . what kind of a basis is that for a so-called moral code ? so what if it involves behaviour ? gay people have sex , develop relationships , and bond , just like everyone else , but in a way that reflects their gay sexuality . this does not mean people could not be prejudiced about the way gay people live . people were , and are so prejudiced . a better reverse analogy would have been to say '' so then __conversly__ __s1__ have the right to advocate that heterosexual relations are morally wrong '' . not __heterosexuality__ , since it 's not homosexuality -lrb- as it 's a state of being -rrb- that religious people have a problem with . heck , they often do n't even recognize it . with that caveat , yes s2 are certainly free to advocate whatever s2 want to be morally wrong . -lrb- and unlike the way some in s2 's movement do , __s1__ wo n't call s2 a '' bigot '' for doing so ! -rrb- it may have been based on '' ignorance '' , but __s1__ reject the notion it was based on prejudice -lrb- and therefore __s1__ tend to agree with the 6 - 0 view of the justices here -rrb- . the 1909 society had too little understanding of gay people to be prejudiced over in the first place . remember , homosexuality was not understood as a state of being at that time . the term itself had not been around long and was not known to most people . and even to those it was known to , it was not known as a state of being . and there certainly was no social identity among gay people as a group -- how could prejudice have existed if there was nothing -lrb- from their perspective -rrb- to be prejudiced toward ? right . provided gays do n't live gay , but live straight , gays can be as gay as they want . as long as gays do n't outwardly show what makes them different from __straights__ , gays can be as gay as they want . it 's bs . also some may not recognize the existence of gay people or their gay lives , but that is putting one 's head in the sand . nonsense . people would widely and __hatefully__ use the term '' __sodomite__ '' to refer to gays . before that the term was '' molly '' . clearly there was an identity they were prejudiced towards . they were rounding up gays in areas they were known to attend , and putting them in prison . read up on the trial of oscar wilde . gays may have been forced underground , to a greater extent , but that does not mean they were not thought of . gays were just not thought of in a nice way . gays were purposely kept out of everything in society , when society did n't really think of gays as human too . that is n't prejudice ? because they did n't approve of sodomy ! do s2 not agree they did n't understand the concept of homosexuality ??? there was no social identity . when they were put on trial , it was n't because they were gay -lrb- which they had no concept of -rrb- , it was because they had gay relations which society viewed as wrong ! no , here 's where s2 do n't get it -- it 's not that '' gays '' -lrb- there was no concept of that -rrb- were purposely kept out of of everything , it 's that people who had sodomy relationships were kept out of everything , because sodomy was viewed as wrong . they really did think it was wrong ! s2 are so determined to portray everything that has anything to do with gay relations possibly being wrong as prejudice and bigotry that s2 are __close-minded__ about it .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : in 1909 , being homosexual was morally wrong , and people could be prejudiced about something that they did not recognize as innate . there was little historical evidence to prove that people in 1909 believed that it was `` right '' or `` good '' to !!__oppress__!! black people or women , and this sentiment extend to homosexuals . in 1909 , people knew that gay sex occurred and they understood its occurrence to be entirely behavioral , and therefore , immoral . homosexuality was not understood as a social identity back then , so there was no `` gay lifestyle '' to be prejudiced against . sodomy was criminalized , not being gay . s2 : there was prejudice against gays in 1909 just as there is now . the !!__immorality__!! of homosexuality in 1909 is based on ignorance . as long as gay people `` lived straight '' , they could be as sexually !!__non-normative__!! as they wanted to be . there were terms for gay men back then , like !!__sodomite__!! and molly , so there was a clear identity for people to be prejudiced against . men who `` acted gay '' were punished for it in 1909 .

Article ->  we all know the possibility exists . __s1__ simply have n't seen anyone present any even half way convincing argument that any of those possibilities are , in fact , a reality . all __s1__ are saying is '' they say it 's morals '' which is no argument at all . calling a tail a leg , etc. . furthermore , why do __s1__ start with the premise that it 's prejudice , rather than needing proof of that -lrb- instead expecting proof of a negative -- that it 's not -rrb- ? __s1__ did n't start with that premise , it 's simply the most likely answer . __s1__ know of no moral system that condones hurting others when said harm is n't preventing some other harm , so morals are out . religion is a good reason for choosing s2 's own actions but it 's no reason for telling others how to live , so that 's out . prejudice against gays has been around for ages , so that 's quite likely . and no other explanations come to mind . straight forward . __s1__ is sure __s1__ have explained this to s2 before , and have invited s2 to come up with alternate explanations . __s1__ do so again . __s1__ is particularly interested to see s2 's response now that s2 seem to have gotten over the idea that simply calling something moral or religious does not mean that it ca n't be prejudice at the same time . and neither does christianity . it too is a moral system . that 's why when people claim religion in their acts of prejudice , they are actually abandoning that moral system , rather than engaging in it . so yes , morals are out -- s2 is glad __s1__ are seeing that now . so s2 finally see that people can claim a moral or religious stance while not actually having one ? excellent ! glad to hear it . now , care to address the matter at hand ? can s2 show me , preferably in reality as opposed to a hypothetical , how one could justify pushing an anti-gay agenda based on actual morals or religion ? because __s1__ have never seen it myself . nice attempt at trying to refute a point that has n't even been made here . the matter at hand is that prejudice may in fact not be what 's behind people 's opposition to gays being in romantic relationships . in some cases -lrb- well , s2 had say many cases -rrb- it 's religious belief , which may be separate from prejudice . the people s2 have been around who __fel__ that way were doing it because of their religious beliefs . in fact , it 's my reason as well . actually it was __s1__ 's point . s2 have refused to acknowledge this so many times in the past that __s1__ could n't even count . __s1__ is glad s2 are past it now . fine , than if it 's s2 's reasoning than spell it out for me . do n't worry about anyone else 's reasoning , just give me yours . take me , step by step , from '' this is __s1__ 's religious belief '' to '' therefore other people should n't be gay -lrb- or act gay or whatever -rrb- '' . leave nothing out , spell out s2 's assumptions , give me the whole ball of wax . because in all __s1__ 's years __s1__ have never once seen anyone come close to doing so without resorting to prejudice . for bonus points extend it all the way to '' and so public policy __disadvantageous__ to gays should be enacted '' . s2 have never said that people ca n't claim to have a moral belief and not really have one . people can conceivably lie about anything -- we ca n't base our discussion on the worry that people might be lying about their stance ; that could be the case in any situation about any issue . no , it 's a religious belief . there 's no more '' reasoning '' to it than believing in faith that christ is a __ressurected__ being . s2 believe it because it 's biblical -- it 's what the bible says . that 's why s2 believe people should n't do it . it 's not so complicated , really . no one is saying you have to believe that way . but it is the way s2 believe , and that 's s2 's business . if s2 imposed s2 's beliefs , that would be one thing , but s2 do n't . s2 do n't impose anything on __s1__ or anyone else , nor do s2 want to . get it ? and yet __s1__ ca n't see how s2 made that jump . s2 believe , fine . but why should n't other people do it ? what do s2 's beliefs have to do with other people 's actions ? so s2 do n't impose ? s2 do n't take any action which could have an obvious negative impact on another person based solely on s2 's religious beliefs ? if that 's true than __s1__ have no problem with you , and s2 are not one of the people __s1__ is talking about here . __s1__ did specify people pushing an anti-gay agenda after all . are s2 saying that the people in '' focus on the family '' , or whatever they are called , are in fact doing wrong then ? since they are clearly trying to impose their views on others , which s2 and __s1__ seem to agree is wrong .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : religion is a good tool to guide one 's own actions , but not for telling others how to live . people have been prejudiced against homosexuals for a long time . moral or religious prejudice is still prejudice . a person can claim a moral or religious stance without having one . you can not justify an anti-gay agenda on morals or religion . an anti-gay stance on the grounds of religious belief is prejudice . prejudice based on religious belief implies that a religious person 's acts of prejudice could have a negative impact on homosexuals , because they believe that being gay is morally reprehensible . s2 : prejudice is a fact of human existence . christianity is a moral system . when people claim religion in morals , they abandon that moral system . it is religious belief - not prejudice - that makes one take an anti-gay stance . the bible says that homosexuality is wrong , so if you believe in the bible as your moral canon , then you believe that homosexuality is wrong as well .

Article ->  new england and new york will probably have gay marriage within the next few years . the west coast might also follow suit after that . __s1__ think the recent wave of gay marriage legalization will stop for the next 20 years or so after that . 30 states already define marriage as between a man and a woman . do n't be so sure . if congress removes doma and with roberts and alito on the court same sex marriage will come to the rest of the country with a 7 to 2 ruling . roberts and alito are constitutional __literalists__ and with doma out of the way the full faith and credit clause is a clear constitutional mandate . can s2 demonstrate evidence that the __scotus__ would nullify gay marriage bans in all states ? if the __scotus__ was so imposed , why do n't they just strike doma down right now and then declare all gay marriage bans unconstitutional ? secondly , states can choose not to recognize gay marriage even without federal doma . there is a choice of law doctrine that allows states to not recognize other states marriages that they find '' offensive '' to their own public policy . states have been not recognizing each others marriages for decades and states do not use the __ffc__ clause to make one state recognize another 's marriage . there is no case history of __ffc__ ever used in this way . even in cases where it has been attempted , the legal argument involved is so lengthy , that it effectively prohibits __ffc__ use due to the sheer amount of hassle and legal proceedings involved in winning such a case . it is called the constitution of the united states a marriage license is a public act and record which __http__ are obviously ignorant of . __http__ completely failed to respond to the choice of law doctrine , as well as __s1__ 's request that __http__ provide justification on __http__ 's claims of how each justice would vote , as well as __s1__ 's challenge to __http__ to explain why doma has not been declared unconstitutional if __http__ 's claims about the justices were true . apparently , the law is beyond __http__ 's comprehension , as is __http__ 's ability to consider facts in forming __http__ 's opinions . in answer to __s1__ 's question . steven , kennedy , souter , ginsburg , and breyer will side with us . roberts and alito will follow the constitution as written . scalia and thomas are a lost anti gay cause . that is how s2 know how they will vote . as to why doma has not been declared unconstitutional is because there has not been a case in the courts challenging doma and so has not been taken up by __scotus__ . i 'll do a little research on s2 's claims . regardless , s2 still failed to address how state courts may use the choice of law doctrine so that the __ffc__ clause does not apply , and if it were , the sheer complication of applying the law would make it effectively prohibitive . by all means , post up the __ffc__ clause again so s2 can avoid addressing this . s2 do not see how choice of law doctrine is not trumped by the full faith and credit clause in cases of marriage contract since there is a current tradition of one state respecting other states marriage licenses when it comes to __heteros__ . the choice of law doctrine is used to settle differences between different state laws . that is how the law is practiced , and that is what courts believe . again , states have been disagreeing on the validity of each other 's marriages for decades and there has been no case history of the full faith and credit clause that has made one state recognize another state 's marriage . courts look to the choice of law doctrine before the __ff__ & c c.
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : legally , it is complicated to legalize gay marriage in all states , as doma is in place and states have chosen not to recognize other state 's marriages for decades . attempts abide by the __ffc__ clause to in respect to marriage -lrb- even before doma -rrb- require such lengthy legal arguments that they are rendered prohibitive . the choice of law doctrine must be considered and doma could be found to be unconstitutional by vote of the __scotus__ . how will states use the choice of law doctrine so that the __ffc__ clause does not apply ? s2 : if congress removes doma , a vote for legal gay marriage will pass quickly , and certain justices of __scotus__ already approve of gay marriage . doma has yet to be declared unconstitutional because there has yet to be a case made to challenge doma in the courts , so it has not been decided upon by __scotus__ . the choice of law doctrine trumps the __ffc__ clause in cases of marriage contract and there is a current tradition of respecting other states marriage licenses for .
generated -> s1 think the recent wave of gay marriage legalization will stop for the next 20 years . if congress removes doma and with roberts and alito on the court same sex marriage will come to the rest of the country with a 7 to 2 ruling . if congress removes doma and with roberts and alito on the court same sex marriage will come to the rest of the country with a 7 to 2 ruling .

's suggestion would be to marry someone s2 do n't want to me married to , that is a different thing . it is not using '' that logic '' . s2 thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you . is n't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities ? s2 am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly . s2 happen to think that 's a bad idea . people get married for many reasons , some of which s2 would feel are not good reasons , but s2 would not make it illegal to do so . s2 am talking about the right to marry a person of 's choosing .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 discuss the civil benefits of marriage and how they could or could not be extended to single people and gay people . __s1__ is initially against government being involved in the equation , but after s2 describes many of the legal rights and benefits associated with marriage , such as automatic inheritance and hospital visitation rights , __s1__ is then able to relate to the issues by considering the case of his life-long bachelor uncle , suggesting that it is single people who are discriminated against by being excluded from the marriage benefits . s2 suggests that if a single person desires the benefits of marriage , they should marry , but that they should be able to marry a person of either gender as they see fit .

Article ->  well ... so far eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue have found that barring same-sex marriage is unconstitutional . we are waiting to hear about three or four more . as for the nature of marriage , it is both a legal contract and -lrb- sometimes -rrb- a religious ceremony -lrb- sacrament in some religions -rrb- . we are stuck with the __duality__ , whether we like it or not , and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect . different religions can do what they want . they found that it violated their state __constitutions__ , right ? this has nothing to do with the us constitution . the winning arguments were based largely on state constitutional provisions that closely parallel , if not outright __mimmick__ , the federal constitution . that 's not generally true , is it ? for example , the massachusetts ruling was based on a specific provision in the mass. constitution that prohibits discrimination based on sexual preference . there 's nothing like that in the us constitution . and s2 's overall point was that we should be careful when calling something '' unconstitutional '' , in that we should be clear it we are talking state or federal constitution . many state __constitutions__ guarantee rights that are n't in the __fedral__ constitution . there 's nothing like that in the mass. . constitution either . though , it 's a __darned__ good idea ! goodrich was decided on equal protection grounds , citing the mass. document . __s1__ had have to look up the others to see the exact reasoning , but they are not likely to be far afield from the bedrock principles of equal protection and due process . gay rights is a real test of our constitutional system , and , so far , we are not passing with flying colors ... __s1__ are right , s2 __misremembered__ . it 's just __descrimination__ based on sex that 's banned .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing the issue of marriage equality . both subjects seem to be on the fence with the issue . __s1__ cites that eight of nine supreme courts have contended same sex marriage to be unconstitutional . s2 questions how gay marriage would violate someone 's constitutional rights . __s1__ advises the bulk of the arguments were based on state __constitutions__ which mirror the federal constitution . s2 uses the example of massachusetts ' allowing gay marriage under its state constitutional law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation . __s1__ contends there is no such piece to the massachusetts constitution . s2 then concedes he was incorrect about the citing and the law actually banned only discrimination based on gender and not sexual orientation .
generated -> marriage , it is both a legal contract and -lrb- sometimes -rrb- a religious ceremony -lrb- sacrament in some religions -rrb- , whether we like it or not , and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect . the winning arguments were based on state constitutional provisions that closely parallel , if not outright mimmick , the federal constitution .

Article ->  it would lead ultimately down the road to a marriage bill for __polygamists__ . that is why the current push for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage also contains a provision banning polygamous marriage as well . hmm ... . some opposition to the petition ... more left wing ideology at work . if the man after god s own heart had multiple wives , why can t i ? have heard others say that we already have polygamy in america . it s called serial polygamy because of our liberal divorce laws . so now those that are opposed to even more laws on the books and a return to old testament practices are considered left wing ? what s this world coming too ? lol king david having multiple wives was under old testament practice . jesus himself stated that divorce laws were granted by moses and allowed by god because of the __hardness__ of the people hearts . jesus said a man shall leave his father and mother and be __cleaved__ to his wife , not wives . __btw__ , its called serial __monogamy__ . if its ' right wing ' to support a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage than its ' left wing ' to oppose a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage . so is it a sin or just a practice ? s2 don t remember jesus saying polygamy was wrong . the statement __s1__ referred to does indicate that he was talking about a single wife , but s2 __wouldn__ t base a whole social convention on one word out of a whole book . anyway the jews don t believe in the new testament . would it be okay for them ? man s2 screwed that one up . s2 ll try to be a little more articulate in the future . okay was just wondering . base 's wing on what think is correct , not left or right . a few years ago it was right wing to be against the deficit , now it seems to be left wing . but that just shows what know about wings . lol the idea that it is now left wing to be against deficits is absurd . numerous democrats actually wanted to spend more than the bush administrations 12.5 % increase in federal spending . s2 was basing that on __s1__ 's previous statement in other words , anything that is opposed to one wing must be the opposite so s2 don t see how it s absurd unless __s1__ want to call __s1__ 's original statement absurd . this is obviously not the thread for this discussion but s2 will reply this time and see where it takes us . __s1__ __didn__ t state what __s1__ considered to be numerous nor did __s1__ supply anything to back up that statement . however deficits depend on both increased spending and lower revenues . bush has done both with large tax cuts and large discretionary spending increases . and even the conservatives are beginning to criticize him for being a big spending president . over the past 23 years , conservative administrations have increased the deficits and liberal administrations have decreased the deficits . so yeah it looks to me like left wing is against deficits and right wing is for deficits .
ref_sum ->  two people are debating the topic of gay marriage rights . __s1__ believes allowing gays to marry will open up the door to legalize other types of marriage such as polygamy . s2 holds to the theory that if king david was able to have multiple wives , why then should the common man not be able to , especially if religion is to now be the basis for all laws . __s1__ contends that practice was of the old testament and is no longer considered commonplace . s2 feels __s1__ is too left wing to entertain the thought of allowing gay marriage , but uses religion as the basis even though there are so many contradictions between the old testament and what is considered the new testament .
generated -> some opposition to the petition ... more left wing ideology at work . if the man after god s own heart had multiple wives , why can t i ? have heard others say that we already have polygamy in america that

ref_sum ->  __s1__ does not believe that anyone outside of a heterosexual marriage should be considered a husband , wife or a spouse because legally they are not . this person believes that the term gay marriage is an __oxymoron__ because marriage , legally , to them , is only between one man and one woman . they believe that prior to roosevelt , society did not accept the idea of state welfare as constitutional , but because people were willing to sacrifice freedom for security , they eventually caved to his ideas . s2 does not believe that marriage is simply between one man and one woman , and that the entire reason behind the debate is so that homosexual marriage can and will be legally recognized . they do not see a reason for discrimination against homosexual marriage .
generated -> s1 pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only , but after reading the cbo report , s1 see that s1 was n't far off . it 's stating that marriage simply is heterosexual , and so completely ends debate that

Article ->  agreed she is ignoring __s1__ 's religious freedom and trying to institute her religion into law . the law that will bar __s1__ 's family from legal protections . it wo n't protect her marriage but will bar me and __s1__ 's people from from being full citizens . she is n't protecting marriage but __perserving__ her heterosexual __privledge__ . how on earth is she impeding on __s1__ religious freedom ? she is n't trying to take away __s1__ 's right to any religious ceremony . with such a wide-open standard of what constitutes religious freedom that __s1__ seem to have , any legislation could be construed as imposing on religious freedom . because it is her religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman . __s1__ 's religious belief is that marriage is between two people that love each other regardless of sex . she is tying to place her religious __belif__ into law over mine . who gets hurt here ? if __s1__ 's religious belief is put into law she can still marry the person of her choice . if her religious belief gets put into law she can still marry the person of her choice but __s1__ do not get to . so __s1__ and __s1__ 's people are hurt by __codifing__ her religious belief into law . she is trying to keep gay people out of marriage and thus preserve her heterosexual __privledge__ . but by that definition , either one could be viewed as impeding on religious freedom , including __s1__ 's view impeding on hers ! we do n't define imposing on religious freedom on the basis of having different ideals . it does n't effect __s1__ 's religion or religious freedom if __s1__ do n't get benefits under gay marriages . __s1__ can argue in other ways , on other basis , but the idea that not giving gays marriage benefits is imposing on religious freedom is an empty '' argument '' . but s2 have not shown how she would be harmed by equal marriage ? __s1__ have shown that her definition infringes upon __s1__ 's religious freedom . if gay marriage becomes a reality then in no way does it infringe upon her in any way . would s2 care to explain how gay marriage infringes upon her in any way ? it is her heterosexual __privledge__ and her __sence__ of entitlement that she is protecting not marriage . __s1__ may -lrb- or may not -rrb- can show harm in another sense , but __s1__ certainly have not shown how __s1__ 's religious rights are taken away or harmed , to begin with . that 's the point . __s1__ certainly have not shown how her definition infringes upon __s1__ 's religious freedom -- __s1__ are still free to be just as religious in practice and belief as ever if __musgrave__ 's views became law . __s1__ are trying to use a religious freedom argument here and it just does n't fit . yes __s1__ have . have n't s2 been __poaying__ attention ? -rsb- because it is her religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman . __s1__ 's religious belief is that marriage is between two people that love each other regardless of sex . she is tying to place her religious __belif__ into law over mine . who gets hurt here ? if __s1__ 's religious belief is put into law she can still marry the person of her choice . if her religious belief gets put into law she can still marry the person of her choice but __s1__ do not get to . so __s1__ and __s1__ 's people are hurt by __codifing__ her religious belief into law . she is trying to keep gay people out of marriage and thus preserve her heterosexual __privledge__ . ok ! s2 's religious belief says that it 's important to smoke in public __non-smoking__ areas . s2 's religious belief says that it 's important to drive cars as fast as one can on city streets . s2 's religious belief says that the death penalty should never be enforced . gee , this it fun , using religion as an excuse and means to an end to fight legislation ! too bad for __s1__ it does n't work that way . what __s1__ do n't get is that , by __s1__ 's standard , either would be placing one religion over another . the same justification could be made against __s1__ 's view because __s1__ 's view goes against my religious belief . and then if __s1__ say '' but __s1__ 's view causes harm and mine does n't '' then it 's no longer a religious issue so the point is moot to begin with . you missed the point here she is trying to turn her religious belief into law that bars me from from getting married . how is she hurt if it is __s1__ 's religious belief of equal marriage is turned into law ? __s1__ have no idea whether or not she is truly trying to turn her religious belief into law . she may just happen to believe that way religiously , but be pushing for the law because she thinks that 's best for __socety__ . __iow__ , __s1__ have no idea if religion is her real motivation for the law . there 's no way to know or to police someone 's real motivations . __s1__ am part of society and her belief is not in __s1__ 's best __intrest__ . how does __s1__ 's being able to marry a man hurt her in any way ?
ref_sum ->  this is about gay marriage . __s1__ seems to believe that someone is making religion into law by saying marriage should be between a heterosexual couple . s2 is arguing that __s1__ 's point is not very valid because __s1__ is not understanding that they are not using the persons perspective . __s1__ believes that that person is trying to hurt them , while s2 is saying that the person may not necessarily be that way and that the person may be arguing for what they believe to be greater for society , based on their own perspective . __s1__ 's religious view of marriage is based on two people 's love for each other , while the other person believes its between a man and woman . s2 says __s1__ 's argument is empty and that __s1__ is not showing how the other person is being hurt by gay marriage . s2 thinks __s1__ is not understanding the overall perspectives and just focusing on their own needs . __s1__ states that the person 's religion put into law affects peoples ability to marry if they are gay , but that __s1__ 's religion on marriage put into law would not affect marriage for anyone .
generated -> the law that will bar s1 's family from legal protections . it wo n't protect her marriage but will bar me and s1 's people from being full citizens . she is trying to keep gay people out of marriage and thus preserve her heterosexual privledge that

Article ->  __s1__ 's __apologizies__ . __s1__ read it hastily and got it completely __bassackwards__ . the cbo estimate in 's link did , indeed , say that the result would be up to ~ $ 1 billion surplus . so __s1__ also recognize that __s1__ 's argument that same-sex marriage does not benefit society is also '' __bassackwards__ '' ? finally ! some progress . remember ... this thread is supposed to be about fiscal concerns . __s1__ have conceded that it does n't have the negative financial impact that __s1__ thought it would . that was the purpose for __s1__ 's attempting to have a civil debate on what __s1__ thought the issues were . __s1__ had like to move past the fiscal concerns and onto the moral and health concerns if we can continue to do s2 with civility . gosh , s2 love a good typo ! in any case , s2 suppose a tepid concession is all we can expect . good catch . and s2 were hoping for ... ? a forthright concession . any maybe some discussion of how same-sex marriage benefits society in practical ways . instead , we are off to __s1__ 's safe ground of '' morality '' . safe , not because __s1__ are right , but because morality is relative and is subjective . __s1__ was hoping that s2 had be telling me the benefits , not vice versa . but s2 forget , __s1__ is not one of '' those '' who feels the need to impose __s1__ 's morality on everyone else . __s1__ is more than willing to let society as a whole determine its own limits . while __s1__ is a staunch defender of the constitution -lrb- as written , not as interpreted -rrb- , __s1__ is way more flexible with public determined acceptable standards of behavior . i 'll even cut __s1__ 's grass so that it is the same level as __s1__ 's neighbors .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ concedes that there would be little financial impact on support for homosexual marriage , and would in fact supply a surplus . however , this person still desires a debate on moral and health concerns of the issue . they do not view themselves as someone who imposes their moral beliefs on others , and is willing to let society determine its own limits . while they vocally defend the united states constitution as written , they also desire to be more flexible with public determined acceptance of behavior . s2 would like to see this concession as a means to lead to a discussion on the societal benefits of same-sex marriage , however , they believe that __s1__ is attempting to hide behind their moral grounds because __s1__ sees it as relative and subjective .

Article ->  should they ? what are western standards ? what were they 20 yrs ago ? what were they 100 yrs ago ? marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract . where would that put families started by artificial insemination ? the same as any other heterosexual couple . it 's not the way children are created -lrb- adopted , __serrogacy__ , etc -rrb- . it ' s the nature of the relationship -lrb- heterosexual -rrb- . natural refers to nature not child bearing . which god enforces marriage rules when the __cermony__ is __performend__ by a judge ? there was a tribe in the congo that allowed it . their __shamans__ told them that the warriors could only marry outer warriors . to be with a women , they thought , might make then softer , and more woman like , and not as fearless in combat . ok , so conceiving a child is not what makes it nature , what is it ? __wouldn__ t polygamy also include some of that same sex taboo , to women marred together ? why do __s1__ feel __s1__ 's values are right and others that disagree as wrong ? polygamy is not women married together . it 's one man or women married to multiple of the opposite sex like a harem or entourage . everyone feels their values are right or else they would n't believe in them . what we value shows . of course atheist do n't believe in god so they have a different set of values . __s1__ of course believe in god first , family second , and country third . if s2 have different values then of course s2 will think yours are better if not then s2 would n't have them . our values are what guide us . __s1__ feel that from perspective __s1__ 's values give someone a better balance and stability to function in society . s2 probably think otherwise but __s1__ feel statistically __s1__ can support mine . sorry , s2 don t practice polygamy ; s2 don t know the inner workings of the family . s2 would think it would be a good way for __bi-sexual__ to stay below the radar . s2 worded the question badly ; s2 should have asked why do __s1__ feel that __s1__ 's morals should be forced on to others ? by keeping the laws the way they are now it is discrimination . correct me if s2 am wrong , but s2 did not think __s1__ could fire some one for being gay . it 's all good __s1__ did n't think s2 knew what s2 were talking about __anyways__ ? the questions is why should they force their moral on us ? should we let other people like nudist and rapist force their __mroals__ on us ? how is allowing them to marry forcing there morals on us ? yes we would have to deal with the fact of it , but the us has been dealing with the fact of polygamy fro years . there is only one case that was prosecuted in recent history -lrb- that was mostly due to one of his wives being 14 when married . when society __legalizes__ behavior it is in fact accepting it as __non-detrimental__ and accepting it . it is a form of forcing our society to accept the behavior .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ makes the claim that marriage is defined as a family unit based on natural heterosexual contact , and suggests that it is the heterosexual nature of the relationship that is important , not how the children are conceived within the relationship . he argues that homosexuals are attempting to force their morals on others by legalizing same-sex marriage , claiming that legalizing a behavior is a tacit form of acceptance that will affect society . s2 questions the religious basis of a civil ceremony like marriage , suggesting that the !!__stipulations__!! based on religious reasons would vary depending on the chosen religion . he also compares homosexuality to polygamy , claiming that polygamy has been unofficially accepted for years , and argues that maintaining the current same-sex marriage bans should be considered discriminatory .
generated -> marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract . where would that put families started by artificial insemination ? the same as any other heterosexual couple . which god enforces marriage rules when the cermony is performend by a judge ? there was a tribe in the congo that the warriors could only marry outer warriors .

Article ->  s2 do know that the gay marriage debate is not synonymous with someone condoning violence against gays , right ? __s1__ seriously doubt anyone here does n't agree with s2 that gays should n't experience violence and name-calling , so that 's not even an issue on the table here . disagree and debate those who believe gay marriage is wrong all s2 want . but do n't dishonestly use arguments about violence , because no one here has argued for that . s2 is sorry , but have __s1__ read archie 's posts ??? he regularly __denigrates__ gays with a variety of slurs . and palin never asked for somebody to threaten obama either . but her rhetoric inflamed people to extremes that are grotesque . oh please . do n't start that subjective __canard__ again . if every religious person who genuinely disagreed with gay marriage because of their religion added a ' __but-no-violence__ ! ' __addendum__ to __everytime__ they weighed in on it , do s2 think anyone actually thinks s2 had be satisfied ? um ... no . it 's funny how the whole violence thing gets used as a __means-to-an-end__ tool by those who argue against religious people on this . well , it would be funny if it were n't sad to some extent . people should n't have to stop standing up for their principles just because of __nutcases__ out there . if the shoe fits ... s2 is talking about the people who proclaim abusive lies about gays . people who put out junk that makes people feel threatened by gays . telling people that gay marriage will makes their kids have to be taught about gay marriage ? that 's a threat . telling people that gay marriage will require churches to have to perform gay marriages ? that 's perceived as a threat too . s2 have no doubt that some people can discuss the subject without inciting . but on the prop 8 battle , the ads clearly were __inciteful__ . do __s1__ think that if a person talks about an abortion doctor '' killing babies '' , that does n't push somebody to think about claiming '' self-defense '' or '' defense of others '' ? how many people do __s1__ think are out there that have attacked a gay person that actually had somebody tell them '' s2 think __s1__ should go out and kill a gay person '' ? it 's built up toxicity from all the anti-gay rhetoric that reaches a boiling point . when the rhetoric __inflames__ , it 's obvious where it starts when somebody gets burned ... oh . and can s2 just say that while s2 am impressed __s1__ did n't try to attack me , __s1__ are doing a bad job of ignoring me ... yeah , when it fits . not other contexts . jason did n't make that distinction which is why __s1__ took issue with him on it . __s1__ did n't say __s1__ was going to start ignoring you , __foundit__ . __s1__ made clear __s1__ was done with that discussion . __s1__ did not say __s1__ was going to stop responding to s2 __foundit__ . and regarding s2 's comment about ' attacking ' , it 's because s2 's tone has changed in the last few posts -- s2 have turned off the hostility some , for __whatver__ reason , and it 's the nature of things that honey draws less flies than **** . that 's why s2 no longer perceive as being '' attacked . '' quite simply , s2 require a __fight-fire-with-fire__ approach , and so tone s2 are treated with -lrb- from me , anyway -rrb- depends entirely on you . and considering he was responding to archie , one of the guys who has got the worst track record on this message board for abusive slurs towards gays , s2 think he was right on track . oh . silly me . so that was just a lame attempt to dodge that conversation then . the one where s2 had just finished explaining how __s1__ were moving the __goal-posts__ and __obfuscating__ up a storm . s2 guess '' __clafclo__ '' was more successful than s2 thought . it 's amusing to watch __s1__ turn on __s1__ 's __passive-aggressive__ claims , and then turn them off again . when __s1__ need it as an excuse , you 'll start whining about '' attacks '' again , even as __s1__ drop claims that s2 should n't be a moderator of any board ... which s2 is sure is n't an '' attack '' or '' personal information '' in __s1__ 's book , hmmm ? and also , __s1__ 's response here is doing exactly what s2 noted on the other thread . __s1__ are dropping the majority of the topical text , and making more of an interest in that one __side-note__ comment ... __s1__ said __namecalling__ and violence , __foundit__ . those were the things jason __conflated__ with opposing gay marriage . once again s2 are being disingenuous again -- respond to what __s1__ actually said for once . show where archie has ever called gays names before , like the f word , or called for violence against gays . if s2 can , i 'll be glad to retract the comment . __namecalling__ and violence are wrong , regardless of where people fall on the issue of gay marriage . in fact , more importantly , they are always wrong no matter what the issue . whatever s2 want to think , __foundit__ . it 's not worth arguing over with a brick wall . __geeez__ __foundit__ . __s1__ suspect personal comments about posters are starting to compete or even outnumber pertinent points about issues s2 are making at this point . __s1__ think __s1__ is going to start using an __acronymn__ whenever s2 do so , that says personal comments & attacks do n't deal with issues . '' __pcaddwi__ '' . that way it will be noted when s2 do it , but it allow s2 to continue dragging down the thread with them . -lrb- or at least you 'll be completely alone in doing so . -rrb- __pcaddwi__ . quote him . quote exactly what he said . cause jason did no such thing ... were __s1__ looking in the mirror when __s1__ said that ? are __s1__ for real ? we have already got archie 's '' __bitchy__ as a gay '' comment . s2 never said he called gays '' __xxxxxx__ '' before . but ai n't it interesting how this board will sensor __######__ or __####__ , but if __s1__ say __xxxxxx__ , it 's __a-ok__ ... the fact that __s1__ argue with me on so many issues , but then throw this arbitrary argument out there , __belittles__ __s1__ 's claim and demonstrates an ulterior motive for ignoring the statement . are __s1__ going to label __s1__ 's own statements as such __jyoshu__ ? cause __s1__ have this boring habit of starting __passive-aggressive__ attacks , belittling other people , and then when somebody calls __s1__ on it or says something about it __s1__ eventually drop it and act surprised when other people point out __s1__ dropped it .
ref_sum ->  this is about the use of arguments of violence towards !!__gay-marriage__!! . __s1__ starts off saying there is a difference between being anti-gay and someone condoning violence against gay people . s2 talks about how violence is used to make people feel threatened to feel a certain way about a topic or debate . s2 used the example of kids being taught about gay marriage in school as a threat . s2 also mentions someone named archie who posts include a variety of slurs towards gay people . __s1__ brushes on the topic , but goes off track from the topic quite a bit . these two people start referring to each others `` attacks '' on each other towards the end . __s1__ says they were referring to !!__namecalling__!! and violence from the original post that was opposing gay rights . these two are n't really in opposite !!__positions/beliefs__!! , but they are more trying to discuss the ways they argue for or against gay marriage and how it may be portrayed by others .

Article ->  what about the __domionists__ ? do they care about other people or do they just care about power ? s2 just did a google search and could n't find a __dominionist__ web site at all . the only articles s2 could find on this devious organization are from radical left leaning groups that s2 believe are making this group up as a red herring to create a reason to promote fear of christians . would __s1__ be so kind as to post a link to the __dominionist__ web site that outlines their agenda to take over the country ? just go to jerry __falwell__ or pat robertson and learn what s2 need to know . so what __s1__ are saying is that __s1__ ca n't produce one objective , independent site or source that is by the __dominionists__ themselves as evidence that they are an actual existing group or organization . if __s1__ could , __s1__ would have . this is just one more example of the diabolical agenda of the radical left to make people fear christianity based on more lies and deception . thanks for revealing who the real paranoid __fearmongers__ are . do s2 's own homework , buddy . then stop making assertions __s1__ ca n't back up with evidence . s2 already told __s1__ s2 googled it and found nothing at all by a __dominionist__ organization at all . but __s1__ implied it 's a real group so prove it or else do n't attempt to use it as a method of __demonizing__ christians as a group . the reason why __s1__ __lefties__ must lie and cheat to win is because the truth is __repugnent__ and foreign to you . and __samiinh__ , it 's fascinating that __s1__ posted that article but declined to post the link . how corrupt are __s1__ to with hold the link because it 's from a leftist site that os promoting the lie of the __dominionist__ 's existence without producing any more proof than __s1__ did . s2 could post a link on google right now asserting that all __lefties__ of the socialist , democratic party persuasion are in fact satan worshipers who sacrifice the babies they kidnap from republican christians on an alter to the devil at each full moon . posting it would n't make it true . even though on its surface it 's much more credible than __s1__ 's bogus story about christian __dominionists__ . now post a link with __s1__ 's __slanderous__ article or delete it for the lie that it is .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ suggests that a christian sect known as the __domionists__ are focused only on gaining power , citing jerry __falwell__ and pat robertson as his sources . s2 claims that he was unable to find any evidence of __domionists__ practices online except from left wing groups . he suggests that the !!__dimionists__!! are not a real religious group , but rather are a group invented by left wing groups to make people fear christianity , and further argues that left leaning individuals rely on lying to achieve their goals because they are unfamiliar with the truth . he also presents an absurd story about people on the political left being satan worshipers in order to demonstrate how posting information without evidence to back it up does not make it automatically true .
generated -> the only articles s2 could find on this devious organization are from radical left leaning groups that s2 believe are making this group up as a red herring to create a reason to promote fear of christians . would s1 be so kind as to post a link to the dominionist web site that outlines their agenda to take over the country ?

Article ->  what sex is n't behaviour ? polygamy is not more acceptable by the standards of western society . __s1__ is not sure __s1__ would call it a significant factor of contemporary western society . it is significant in patriarchal societies . no court or government in western society has recognized marriage rights for __polygamists__ . should they ? what are western standards ? what were they 20 yrs ago ? what were they 100 yrs ago ? marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract . it 's not just for a heterosexual contract in the netherlands , belgium , most of canada , and probably not limited that way for much longer in sweden and spain . it wo n't be just for a heterosexual contract in mass. in may . there are married heterosexual couples who either choose to not have children , or can not have children . so it is not just for having a family unit with children either . this is n't europe . there __dirinking__ laws , __prostituition__ laws , and many other laws are different than ours . so are many other countries . if we want to talk about the world the over 90 % of the world does n't recognize homosexuality . mass is taking __stpes__ to ban it . hawaii did the same thing in 1997 and their legislature stopped it . s2 believe mass will do the same . a family is the basic unit in society traditionally consisting of two parents rearing their own or adopted children ; also any of various social units differing from but regarded as equivalent to the traditional family . we are talking about traditional families . a family can be just a wife and husband . it ca n't be two husbands . well , europe or canada is more similar to the u.s. than iran or saudi arabia or namibia . any steps will take years , after the legal marriages have already taken place , if those steps are even successful . single parent families are not generally viewed as traditional . yeah this country is more similar to anglo countries . what 's __s1__ 's point ? what happens in 2050 when they predict __minorites__ will be over 50 % of this country ? hawaii did it in a year . but it is __veiwed__ as natural look at the current __hoity-toity__ polls which show strong support for gay rights among those 18 - 29 . __s1__ do n't see polygamy as a value among minorities in the u.s. hawaii was different , as the legislature made changes against marriage for gays , while the stayed decision was being appealed to the supreme court . so is casual sex and rabies . we do n't judge something as good simply because it is natural . single parenthood is not viewed as the moral traditional ideal among conservatives . they do n't ask them about polygamy . also gays rights is more political than anything else . it does n't really matter does it . we 'll see in the end who 's right . single parent is natural . many husbands die early . that 's natural . __unwed__ mothers is not considered moral but it 's still natural . casual sex is natural but not rational . it will lead to other problems . rabies are viruses . rabies are n't even alive so how can __s1__ call that natural ?
ref_sum ->  s2 claims that marriage is defined as a family unit based on a heterosexual contract . __s1__ refutes this assertion , citing a number of countries which recognize same-sex marriage and compares the lack of reproductive potential for homosexual couples to a heterosexual couple that chooses not to have children or is unable to have children . he also argues that single parent families are not considered traditional and references a poll showing support for gay rights among the 18 - 29 demographic . s2 claims that a traditional family is composed of a husband and wife and that the laws of other countries are irrelevant to the laws of america . he argues that single parent families are natural and suggests that time will decide which side is right .

Article ->  it 's a consideration for many reasons . it 's a tremendous new tax on businesses , the social security system and healthcare systems because this would create a new '' dependent class '' that does n't presently exist . make no mistake about it , gay marriage is about economics . any claims to the contrary are simply false . are __s1__ saying that gay people who pay into the same systems , should n't also benefit ? speaking of dependency , imagine a scenario where a gay person is in a same-sex marriage , that is not legally recognized . this person is also dependent on the other spouse . the marriage breaks up . now , the taxpayer must support the dependent partner , because the marriage was not legally recognized . if it were legal , the richer partner could have been made to support the poorer one , after divorce . same sex marriage marriage partners that are n't legally __mrried__ are called roommates . do we want to start giving benefits to all singles sharing apartments regardless of sexual bent ? that is a separate issue , and could also involve different sex people . we are not talking about singles , or __roomates__ , when we talk of marriage . s2 do n't see __roomates__ sharing an apartment arguing for such a recognition or responsibility . as much as many trust and care for their __roomates__ , it 's not by that much . no , we are not talking about marriage . we are talking about a relationship that some want us to all believe is a marriage . well , if __s1__ want to marry __s1__ 's dog , can i ? of course __s1__ ca n't . it all goes back to the definition of marriage and jack and jack ai n't it . here we go again . if these types of arguments are the best the right wing can come up with and just repeat and repeat ad __nauseum__ , then good luck . in mass. , in ontario , in british columbia , in quebec , in belgium and the netherlands , jack and jack are it . __s1__ is not a right winger . right wingers are way too far left for me . __s1__ is a __jeffersonian__ liberal . __s1__ believe in the constitution as written . they are only allowed in mass. because the '' people 's will '' has n't been heard yet . the majority of americans are against same sex marriage , no matter how s2 try to spin it , so __s1__ is guessing that the laws will be solidified so that any ambiguity is removed very soon . as for canada and the netherlands , __s1__ could care less . __s1__ do n't live or pay a dime in taxes to support either . are __s1__ speaking of the federal marriage __ammendment__ to the u.s. constitution ? everything s2 have heard indicates it 's a long shot . at any rate , it is just a guess what will or wo n't happen a few years in the future . s2 was just pointing out what was happening internationally -lrb- mass. is international for me , a canadian -rrb- .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that the issue of same-sex marriage is an economic issue because it would have negative effects on businesses , social security , and the healthcare systems . he compares homosexual partners to roommates and and demonstrates that you can not make marriage mean whatever you want by explaining that he is not legally allowed to marry his dog . he makes it clear that he believes same-sex marriage is wrong and claims that the majority of americans are also against same-sex marriage . s2 suggests that homosexual partners would not be a burden on the mentioned systems because they would be paying into the systems as well as receiving benefits from them . he cites the legalization of same-sex marriages in various other countries in europe and north america .
generated -> tremendous new tax on businesses , the social security system and healthcare systems because this would create a new '' dependent class '' that does n't presently exist . make no mistake about it , gay people who pay into the same systems , should n't also benefit ? speaking of dependency , imagine a scenario where a gay person is in a same-sex marriage , that is not legally recognized that

Article ->  they did leave in a very key statement in the provision essentially making it __non-mandatory__ to some extent '' but it also says marriage officers need not perform a ceremony between same-sex couples if doing so would conflict with his or her '' conscience , religion and belief . '' -lrb- at least they have recognized that making officials do that may be infringing on their religious freedom . the link does n't work . this is unfortunate if it applies to public officials . s2 believe public officials are there to serve all members of the public , equally under the law . that 's their job . s2 is glad they have to do their job in canada . would __http__ want a public servant to refuse __http__ because he or she does not share __http__ 's evangelical beliefs , __jyoshu__ ? __s1__ certainly would not want someone forced to do something against their religious beliefs . if __s1__ went to a public official and it were against their religious belief to perform a heterosexual civil ceremony , __s1__ had simply find someone that would , rather than try to force that person to do it . here 's the corrected link , by the way if one ca n't do the job , one should look for another job . apparently not , in south africa . __s1__ do n't see why marriage freedom should automatically trump religious freedom , and apparently sa feels the same way . do __s1__ agree with me then , that this is an impediment to the public servant doing his or her job ? this is nonsense . s2 is glad s2 live in canada , where the religion of others is not imposed into s2 's life .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ cites a key statement in the same-sex marriage legislation that allows marriage officers the right not to perform a same-sex marriage if it conflicts with their conscience , religion , or beliefs . he believes this is a good caveat , claiming that forcing officials to perform same-sex marriages would be infringing upon their religious freedom . he argues that if a public official had a religious objection to heterosexual marriages , then he would not expect that person to perform his marriage and would instead seek out someone who would . s2 believes it is inappropriate for public officials to be able to deny services based on their personal religious beliefs . if they are unable to do their job , he suggests , they should not be able to hold that position .

Article ->  withers dc council votes for gay marriage by james withers , contributing editor , 365 gay blog __12.15.2009__ pm est in a 11 - 2 vote , the city council of washington , dc voted for gay marriage . we are a bit __short-handed__ today , so expect more about this later . until then have a sip of the bubbly and congrats to the district . wait until it 's put on a ballot for the voters to decide . this is n't the first time that a liberal government did n't pay attention to the will of the people . and what is the will of the people jp ? people in support of marriage equality is steadily growing . compare the polls from ten years ago to now to see ... it is only a matter of time before equality stands upon the side of the majority . s2 keep hearing gays say that but every time it 's put to a vote , __s1__ lose . s2 had say that it 's time to try another tact because the current one is a losing proposition . the only thing forcing gay marriage on a population does is galvanize them against the forced action . and when they respond on the ballot , they do so __punatively__ . just wait until __s1__ see the repercussions of the current efforts to give all federal employee 's same sex partners __bennies__ on our dime despite doma . s2 is guessing that some additional democratic heads will roll in the fall election if that flies . __s1__ need a pr strategy that highlights the advantages of gay unions over __bathhouse__ and gay bar __existences__ . s2 believe that a true majority of people would support civil unions but not marriage . and s2 count myself amongst that majority . actually jp so far 5 states have passed gay marriage so no not every time it is put to a vote do we lose . and how am __s1__ forcing anyone to accept gay marriage ? am __s1__ forcing these voters to attend __s1__ 's wedding or dare __s1__ say be in a marriage themselves ? and __s1__ can not agree with s2 more about changing the image of the gay community as a whole . . we are not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people running around ... what __s1__ find funny is once strait people find out how boring we really are , and how we pay taxes just like every other joe __schmo__ they 'll think nothing more of special rights lol ... but actually like __s1__ stated earlier in another thread if those unions constituted the same legal rights as married couples __s1__ would be content . which 5 states put gay marriage on the ballot and it won ? to the best of s2 's knowledge , no state that has gay marriage today has ever gotten it via the ballot . it has either been the court or legislature that has forced it on the state . the gays s2 know are as boring as mr and mrs john q. public as well , but that 's not the image that is portrayed to the general public . like s2 said , __s1__ have a pr problem . s2 think that if more gays were willing to settle for civil unions that were more equivalent to marriage , __s1__ had have an easier time gaining legal acceptance . ok maybe not the ballot ... got me there man . lol ... . maine was a close one though . and yeah we got a major pr problem big time ... and __s1__ said as long as we got the legal rights of marriage and called it __cu__ __s1__ would be cool with that . __s1__ already wear a dress and heels enough as it is ! __lmao__ jk ... . s2 hope that you , at least , shave __s1__ 's legs . __;-rrb-__ oh __s1__ do ... __lmao__ __naw__ __s1__ do n't wear a dress __s1__ would n't look good in one ...
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : washington dc ' s city council recently legalized gay marriage . people 's support of gay marriage has been growing steadily in the past ten years , and will soon be the majority opinion . five states have already legalized gay marriage . those opposed to gay marriage may view gays as promiscuous and sexual !!__deviants__!! , but most gay men are !!__assuredly__!! quite normal . civil unions will not be accepted in place of marriage , as they do not allow the same legal rights as marriage . s2 : councils and legislatures may vote in favor of gay marriage , but it has yet to be the majority vote of the people . gay marriage should be played in a positive light by its supporters , because the current public perception of gay men is that they are promiscuous and lead a `` gay lifestyle '' that is offensive . anti-gay marriage supporters will support civil unions in lieu of gay marriage , and homosexuals should be satisfied with that .

Article ->  so , then 2 gays people living together in va should n't expect healthcare , since a couple who is n't married does n't get it . '' thats just the way it is '' is n't much of an argument ! so , basically __s1__ do n't care that some people can have rights , while others who should have them do n't get them . so , s2 take it __s1__ liked segregation , __prohabition__ and prefer women barefoot in the kitchen rather than at the polls voting for anything . wow ! all s2 an say is wow . __s1__ is guessing s2 mean '' prohibition '' . gays do n't have the right to shared healthcare because they are not married ! gays have rights ... they can marry members of the opposite sex . nobody can marry members of the opposite sex , it 's not just gays . gays have all the rights that straight people do . __straights__ ca n't marry people of the same sex , and neither can gays . if __straigh__ people want __heatlcare__ , they can marry someone of the opposite sex ... so can gays ! we do n't have the right to marry who we love and if ya did n't notice it is n't someone of the same sex . what a __ridculous__ posts ! we are fighting to the right to marry , we will win , we will have healthcare and we are in __s1__ 's neighborhood too ! trust me , we are nor backing down to the __xtian__ right wing . we shall overcome ! haha !! it seems like '' s2 all '' are going in the wrong direction then . thousands of gays in san francisco recently had their marriages __enulled__ . a judge in seattle was also told he ca n't allow gays to get married . missouri just voted to outlaw gay marriage -lrb- 70 % of the people voted to ban it ... pretty alarming if s2 ask me -rrb- . how do s2 figure s2 are in the process to '' overcome '' ? it looks quite the opposite if s2 ask me . the only luck s2 have is moving to another country or moving to massachusetts . mark __s1__ 's word , there will never be a federal law allowing gay marriages in the us . that 's just what they said about slavery , women voting , __interacial__ marriage . it is what they said about people flying , looking for a cure to polio , it is always darkest before the dawn ! looking at slavery is incorrect . slavery was wrong because certain individuals who could n't change their color were targeted and often tortured . they were treated as property and had no rights . however , gays have the exact same rights as __heterosexuals__ and are not property , nor can they be targeted by color , etc. . women voting is also a terrible example . that has to do with free speech , which is an __unalienable__ right -lrb- last time __s1__ checked , gays being allowed to marry was n't an __unalienable__ right -rrb- . that was also when women could n't hold jobs and had to work in the home . gays do n't have to do that . interracial marriage goes along with slavery and is an absolutely terrible example . it was looked down upon , not illegal . thomas jefferson had children by a black woman .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that homosexual partners should n't expect shared healthcare in the same way that an unmarried couple should n't . he suggests that homosexuals are not being denied any rights , that they have all the same rights as !!__heterosexuals__!! . he points out that nobody can marry someone of the same sex , not just homosexuals . he rejects the idea that homosexuals will succeed in legalizing same-sex marriage , citing several cases where homosexual marriages were banned . s2 accuses __s1__ of accepting that some people should not receive the basic right to marry the person they love . he likens this to slavery , prohibition , and women 's suffrage . he claims that the proponents of same-sex marriage will eventually be successful , just as human rights advocates were with slavery , voting , and interracial marriage .

Article ->  s2 do know that the gay marriage debate is not synonymous with someone condoning violence against gays , right ? __s1__ seriously doubt anyone here does n't agree with s2 that gays should n't experience violence and name-calling , so that 's not even an issue on the table here . disagree and debate those who believe gay marriage is wrong all s2 want . but do n't dishonestly use arguments about violence , because no one here has argued for that . s2 is sorry , but have __s1__ read archie 's posts ??? he regularly __denigrates__ gays with a variety of slurs . and palin never asked for somebody to threaten obama either . but her rhetoric inflamed people to extremes that are grotesque . oh please . do n't start that subjective __canard__ again . if every religious person who genuinely disagreed with gay marriage because of their religion added a ' __but-no-violence__ !

'' quite simply , s2 require a __fight-fire-with-fire__ approach , and so tone s2 are treated with -lrb- from me , anyway -rrb- depends entirely on you . and considering he was responding to archie , one of the guys who has got the worst track record on this message board for abusive slurs towards gays , s2 think he was right on track . oh . silly me . so that was just a lame attempt to dodge that conversation then . the one where s2 had just finished explaining how __s1__ were moving the __goal-posts__ and __obfuscating__ up a storm . s2 guess '' __clafclo__ '' was more successful than s2 thought . it 's amusing to watch __s1__ turn on __s1__ 's __passive-aggressive__ claims , and then turn them off again . when __s1__ need it as an excuse , you 'll start whining about '' attacks '' again , even as __s1__ drop claims that s2 should n't be a moderator of any board ... which s2 is sure is n't an '' attack '' or '' personal information '' in __s1__ 's book , hmmm ? and also , __s1__ 's response here is doing exactly what s2 noted on the other thread . __s1__ are dropping the majority of the topical text , and making more of an interest in that one __side-note__ comment ... __s1__ said __namecalling__ and violence , __foundit__ . those were the things jason __conflated__ with opposing gay marriage . once again s2 are being disingenuous again -- respond to what __s1__ actually said for once . show where archie has ever called gays names before , like the f word , or called for violence against gays . if s2 can , i 'll be glad to retract the comment . __namecalling__ and violence are wrong , regardless of where people fall on the issue of gay marriage . in fact , more importantly , they are always wrong no matter what the issue . whatever s2 want to think , __foundit__ . it 's not worth arguing over with a brick wall . __geeez__ __foundit__ . __s1__ suspect personal comments about posters are starting to compete or even outnumber pertinent points about issues s2 are making at this point . __s1__ think __s1__ is going to start using an __acronymn__ whenever s2 do so , that says personal comments & attacks do n't deal with issues .

Article ->  any two adults can run the household , one can make the decision if the other is incapacitated , one inherits when the other dies , etc etc. . that parallel does not carry over to group marriages . when one dies , who inherits ? if one is __incapacitied__ , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two , so __recongnising__ group marriages is a huge legal task , and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious . if we are talking about legal recognition , and we are -lrb- right ? -rrb- , then the cases are wildly different . our marriage laws , for better or worse , are set up on the assumption of two adults running a household . they also assume man and wife , true , but do n't actually depend on that . but the dependence on there being two people is embedded in the laws ; changing that is a huge project . yes , but gays would also want laws changed to __accomodate__ their form of marriage as well . the fact that one requires less change than the other should n't matter , should it ? should having to do more __reworking__ of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality ? it seems to me __s1__ 's argument boils down to '' polygamy requires more work to make the laws __accomodate__ it . '' yeah -- such is the price for marriage equality . let 's face it -- if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for __opposite-sex__ couples which comprise most relationships , they could pull it off -- polygamy , gays , letting 17 year olds marry , etc. . all those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed . means could be set up to determine inheritance , for example . laws can be worded to do it . see , this is why we try to avoid this debate . those who oppose gay marriage inevitably put their own spin on it and drag it to silly conclusion . here we see what gays really want turned into '' make marriage an open-ended institution of equality '' , which then means gay , poly , and 17 year olds in this case . __jyoshu__ stopped there , but it 's not uncommon for it then to go to children , cousins , dogs , whatever . this issue is not '' let 's let everyone do anything they like '' , that 's just the common __reframing__ we see whenever poly relations are brought up while __disscusing__ gay marriage . it happens all the time , it gets old , and that 's why people who have gone through it a bunch of times tend to __aviod__ the whole thing . it happens because there 's no way to avoid logical conclusions . believe it or not , cultural and legal precedent is a very real thing . the events in the article __exemplify__ this . if __s1__ argue to broaden marriage -lrb- which __s1__ are -rrb- , then this is what __s1__ have to deal with . as __s1__ said , s2 did stop with polygamy , gay , and barely lowering the age of consent , so why are you bringing up all the other examples like '' children , cousins dogs , '' or whatever , as if __s1__ were ready to pounce on that ? __s1__ are arguing against degrees that s2 did n't even say , or that no one said . now , do __s1__ have any response to s2 's point that __s1__ 's argument boils down to nothing more than '' polygamy requires more work to make the laws __accomodate__ it '' , or are __s1__ just going to avoid it by getting __sidetracked__ by the fact __s1__ do n't like that we are even talking about this ? again , society can deal with issues like polygamy if they really want to . sure there is . s2 can start with an erroneous assumption , like s2 did , and then arrive at an illogical conclusion , like s2 did . why do n't s2 read the exchanges between me and phyllis ; __s1__ think most of s2 's issues will be addressed that way . do __s1__ feel that opening marriage to gay couples is not a case of broadening marriage ? how is that an erroneous assumption ? sure , but s2 asked __s1__ some specific questions that __s1__ seem to be avoiding . in __s1__ 's exchange with phyllis s2 may comment on matters s2 disagree with . listen to yourself ! we start with '' gays want to get married '' , s2 change it to '' make marriage an open-ended institution of equality '' , and now s2 __segue__ over to '' broadening marriage '' . s2 's erroneous assumption is s2 's statement of what gays are trying to accomplish . until s2 stop trying to change what gays really want into something that s2 can argue against more easily all s2 's arguments will be based on erroneous assumptions . actually , __s1__ did address them . while debating with phyllis . naturally . and naturally __s1__ may ignore them if __s1__ think they are diversions . what gays are trying or not trying -lrb- in terms of intent -rrb- is not the issue . what is the crux here is that marriage would be broadened . it 's not rocket science . __s1__ are moving the boundaries of what constitutes a marriage to include more than __opposite-sex__ couples . very straightforward . s2 know __s1__ do n't like it __phrased__ that way , but that 's what it is . __s1__ ca n't take a phrase like ' gays want to get married '' without looking at the overall implications . in terms of legal rights , s2 do n't see why it would be any different . equality in marriage is equality in marriage regardless of the cultural motivation -- religious , being in love with more than one person , or simply just for the hell of it . for that matter , the argument could be made that __opposite-sex__ marriage between 2 people is largely a religious construct ! i 'll try to explain this to s2 one more time . the stated purpose of gays is quite __relevent__ if s2 are trying to argue against it . gays want to get married . one side effect of that is that some people will see the scope of marriage broadened . gays are not , in and of itself , trying to broaden marriage . they did not wake up one day and say '' let 's try to broaden the scope of marriage today , that 'll be fun ! '' s2 's arguments run along the lines of '' if s2 want to __braoden__ marriage , than s2 must __excpet__ it broadening in all these other ways '' and that 's why s2 's __rephrasing__ does n't work . broadening marriage is n't the goal , it 's a side effect , and since it is n't the goal we do n't have to accept all these other things s2 claim would be the result if they were trying to broaden marriage . to recap , s2 's arguments are based on s2 's assumption that gays want to broaden marriage , that that is their __ulitmate__ goal , the pinnacle of the cause . gays getting married to s2 seems to be the means to that end . that is , of course , backwards , and so s2 's __sematic__ based arguments fail . __kronos__ , s2 just told __s1__ s2 am not dealing here with what gays are trying / not trying to do in terms of intent , yet __s1__ are are arguing as if s2 never even said that . s2 am not arguing what gays have as intent . s2 completely understand what __s1__ are saying . s2 's point here is based on the effect of their intents , whatever that intent is . there is simply no way to get around the fact that if __s1__ change marriage to include other that __opposite-sex__ couples -lrb- to any number of other possibilities -- even one -rrb- , __s1__ are broadening marriage . whether or not gays set out out to do this in terms of a goal is irrelevant . __s1__ are attacking some point about intent that s2 have n't made -- s2 is talking about the effect here . to latch onto some straw man of '' intent '' is to completely miss the point . __s1__ is not ignoring this post , __s1__ is simply choosing not to respond because it 's a pointless distraction in an otherwise __interesing__ thread . if s2 want to start another thread on this theme i 'll explain there how wrong s2 are . well , __s1__ are the one that 's taking issue and making it a distraction !
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : !!__opposers__!! to gay marriage often jump to conclusions about who can get married - why not cousins , group marriages , children , dogs ? polygamous marriage raises legal concerns that are not currently covered in traditional marriage laws , for example . the goal of gay marriage supporters is to be able to get married - not to broaden marriage . broadened marriage is a side effect of legal gay marriage . s2 : gay marriage supporters want marriage laws changed to accommodate gay marriage . broadened marriage could change the current traditional marriage laws . polygamy , for example , would require more marriage laws changed than gay marriage would , as more people are involved . but if enough people wanted legal polygamous marriage , the laws would be passed . marriage would be broadened if gay marriage is made legal , whether that is the goal of gay marriage or not .
generated -> if one is incapacitied , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that parallel does not carry over to group marriages . if one is incapacitied , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two , so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task , and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious that

ref_sum ->  __s1__ : religion is a good tool to guide one 's own actions , but not for telling others how to live . people have been prejudiced against homosexuals for a long time . moral or religious prejudice is still prejudice . a person can claim a moral or religious stance without having one . you can not justify an anti-gay agenda on morals or religion . an anti-gay stance on the grounds of religious belief is prejudice . prejudice based on religious belief implies that a religious person 's acts of prejudice could have a negative impact on homosexuals , because they believe that being gay is morally reprehensible . s2 : prejudice is a fact of human existence . christianity is a moral system . when people claim religion in morals , they abandon that moral system . it is religious belief - not prejudice - that makes one take an anti-gay stance . the bible says that homosexuality is wrong , so if you believe in the bible as your moral canon , then you believe that homosexuality is wrong as well .

Article ->  new england and new york will probably have gay marriage within the next few years . the west coast might also follow suit after that . __s1__ think the recent wave of gay marriage legalization will stop for the next 20 years or so after that . 30 states already define marriage as between a man and a woman . do n't be so sure . if congress removes doma and with roberts and alito on the court same sex marriage will come to the rest of the country with a 7 to 2 ruling . roberts and alito are constitutional __literalists__ and with doma out of the way the full faith and credit clause is a clear constitutional mandate . can s2 demonstrate evidence that the __scotus__ would nullify gay marriage bans in all states ? if the __scotus__ was so imposed , why do n't they just strike doma down right now and then declare all gay marriage bans unconstitutional ? secondly , states can choose not to recognize gay marriage even without federal doma . there is a choice of law doctrine that allows states to not recognize other states marriages that they find '' offensive '' to their own public policy . states have been not recognizing each others marriages for decades and states do not use the __ffc__ clause to make one state recognize another 's marriage . there is no case history of __ffc__ ever used in this way . even in cases where it has been attempted , the legal argument involved is so lengthy , that it effectively prohibits __ffc__ use due to the sheer amount of hassle and legal proceedings involved in winning such a case . it is called the constitution of the united states a marriage license is a public act and record which __http__ are obviously ignorant of . __http__ completely failed to respond to the choice of law doctrine , as well as __s1__ 's request that __http__ provide justification on __http__ 's claims of how each justice would vote , as well as __s1__ 's challenge to __http__ to explain why doma has not been declared unconstitutional if __http__ 's claims about the justices were true . apparently , the law is beyond __http__ 's comprehension , as is __http__ 's ability to consider facts in forming __http__ 's opinions . in answer to __s1__ 's question . steven , kennedy , souter , ginsburg , and breyer will side with us . roberts and alito will follow the constitution as written . scalia and thomas are a lost anti gay cause . that is how s2 know how they will vote . as to why doma has not been declared unconstitutional is because there has not been a case in the courts challenging doma and so has not been taken up by __scotus__ . i 'll do a little research on s2 's claims . regardless , s2 still failed to address how state courts may use the choice of law doctrine so that the __ffc__ clause does not apply , and if it were , the sheer complication of applying the law would make it effectively prohibitive . by all means , post up the __ffc__ clause again so s2 can avoid addressing this . s2 do not see how choice of law doctrine is not trumped by the full faith and credit clause in cases of marriage contract since there is a current tradition of one state respecting other states marriage licenses when it comes to __heteros__ . the choice of law doctrine is used to settle differences between different state laws . that is how the law is practiced , and that is what courts believe . again , states have been disagreeing on the validity of each other 's marriages for decades and there has been no case history of the full faith and credit clause that has made one state recognize another state 's marriage . courts look to the choice of law doctrine before the __ff__ & c c.
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : legally , it is complicated to legalize gay marriage in all states , as doma is in place and states have chosen not to recognize other state 's marriages for decades . attempts abide by the __ffc__ clause to in respect to marriage -lrb- even before doma -rrb- require such lengthy legal arguments that they are rendered prohibitive . the choice of law doctrine must be considered and doma could be found to be unconstitutional by vote of the __scotus__ . how will states use the choice of law doctrine so that the __ffc__ clause does not apply ? s2 : if congress removes doma , a vote for legal gay marriage will pass quickly , and certain justices of __scotus__ already approve of gay marriage . doma has yet to be declared unconstitutional because there has yet to be a case made to challenge doma in the courts , so it has not been decided upon by __scotus__ . the choice of law doctrine trumps the __ffc__ clause in cases of marriage contract and there is a current tradition of respecting other states marriage licenses for .
generated -> s1 think the recent wave of gay marriage legalization will stop for the next 20 years . if congress removes doma and with roberts and alito on the court same sex marriage will come to the rest of the country with a 7 to 2 ruling . if congress removes doma and with roberts and alito on the court same sex marriage will come to the rest of the country with a 7 to 2 ruling .

Article ->  withers dc council votes for gay marriage by james withers , contributing editor , 365 gay blog __12.15.2009__ pm est in a 11 - 2 vote , the city council of washington , dc voted for gay marriage . we are a bit __short-handed__ today , so expect more about this later . until then have a sip of the bubbly and congrats to the district . wait until it 's put on a ballot for the voters to decide . this is n't the first time that a liberal government did n't pay attention to the will of the people . and what is the will of the people jp ? people in support of marriage equality is steadily growing . compare the polls from ten years ago to now to see ... it is only a matter of time before equality stands upon the side of the majority . s2 keep hearing gays say that but every time it 's put to a vote , __s1__ lose . s2 had say that it 's time to try another tact because the current one is a losing proposition . the only thing forcing gay marriage on a population does is galvanize them against the forced action . and when they respond on the ballot , they do so __punatively__ . just wait until __s1__ see the repercussions of the current efforts to give all federal employee 's same sex partners __bennies__ on our dime despite doma . s2 is guessing that some additional democratic heads will roll in the fall election if that flies . __s1__ need a pr strategy that highlights the advantages of gay unions over __bathhouse__ and gay bar __existences__ . s2 believe that a true majority of people would support civil unions but not marriage . and s2 count myself amongst that majority . actually jp so far 5 states have passed gay marriage so no not every time it is put to a vote do we lose . and how am __s1__ forcing anyone to accept gay marriage ? am __s1__ forcing these voters to attend __s1__ 's wedding or dare __s1__ say be in a marriage themselves ? and __s1__ can not agree with s2 more about changing the image of the gay community as a whole . . we are not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people running around ... what __s1__ find funny is once strait people find out how boring we really are , and how we pay taxes just like every other joe __schmo__ they 'll think nothing more of special rights lol ... but actually like __s1__ stated earlier in another thread if those unions constituted the same legal rights as married couples __s1__ would be content . which 5 states put gay marriage on the ballot and it won ? to the best of s2 's knowledge , no state that has gay marriage today has ever gotten it via the ballot . it has either been the court or legislature that has forced it on the state . the gays s2 know are as boring as mr and mrs john q. public as well , but that 's not the image that is portrayed to the general public . like s2 said , __s1__ have a pr problem . s2 think that if more gays were willing to settle for civil unions that were more equivalent to marriage , __s1__ had have an easier time gaining legal acceptance . ok maybe not the ballot ... got me there man . lol ... . maine was a close one though . and yeah we got a major pr problem big time ... and __s1__ said as long as we got the legal rights of marriage and called it __cu__ __s1__ would be cool with that . __s1__ already wear a dress and heels enough as it is ! __lmao__ jk ... . s2 hope that you , at least , shave __s1__ 's legs . __;-rrb-__ oh __s1__ do ... __lmao__ __naw__ __s1__ do n't wear a dress __s1__ would n't look good in one ...
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : washington dc ' s city council recently legalized gay marriage . people 's support of gay marriage has been growing steadily in the past ten years , and will soon be the majority opinion . five states have already legalized gay marriage . those opposed to gay marriage may view gays as promiscuous and sexual !!__deviants__!! , but most gay men are !!__assuredly__!! quite normal . civil unions will not be accepted in place of marriage , as they do not allow the same legal rights as marriage . s2 : councils and legislatures may vote in favor of gay marriage , but it has yet to be the majority vote of the people . gay marriage should be played in a positive light by its supporters , because the current public perception of gay men is that they are promiscuous and lead a `` gay lifestyle '' that is offensive . anti-gay marriage supporters will support civil unions in lieu of gay marriage , and homosexuals should be satisfied with that .

ref_sum ->  s2 suggests that he would be liberal if modern liberalism was actually __jeffersonian__ , meaning that democracy is viewed as the power of the people . he cites jefferson 's beliefs that war can be necessary in order to maintain liberty and that centralized government is a threat , and points out how these beliefs are the opposite of modern liberalism . he further claims that the current democratic party is __anti-religion__ , __over-regulatory__ , and controlled by the gay lobby . __s1__ !!__interprets__!! s2 's argument as a claim that fairness should exist for all people except homosexuals . s2 !!__clarifies__!! that he does support equal opportunity for all people regardless of their sexual behavior , but that he is still opposed to redefining the traditional view of marriage by legalizing same-sex marriage for homosexuals .

Article ->  it would lead ultimately down the road to a marriage bill for __polygamists__ . that is why the current push for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage also contains a provision banning polygamous marriage as well . hmm ... . some opposition to the petition ... more left wing ideology at work . if the man after god s own heart had multiple wives , why can t i ? have heard others say that we already have polygamy in america . it s called serial polygamy because of our liberal divorce laws . so now those that are opposed to even more laws on the books and a return to old testament practices are considered left wing ? what s this world coming too ? lol king david having multiple wives was under old testament practice . jesus himself stated that divorce laws were granted by moses and allowed by god because of the __hardness__ of the people hearts . jesus said a man shall leave his father and mother and be __cleaved__ to his wife , not wives . __btw__ , its called serial __monogamy__ . if its ' right wing ' to support a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage than its ' left wing ' to oppose a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage . so is it a sin or just a practice ? s2 don t remember jesus saying polygamy was wrong . the statement __s1__ referred to does indicate that he was talking about a single wife , but s2 __wouldn__ t base a whole social convention on one word out of a whole book . anyway the jews don t believe in the new testament . would it be okay for them ? man s2 screwed that one up . s2 ll try to be a little more articulate in the future . okay was just wondering . base 's wing on what think is correct , not left or right . a few years ago it was right wing to be against the deficit , now it seems to be left wing . but that just shows what know about wings . lol the idea that it is now left wing to be against deficits is absurd . numerous democrats actually wanted to spend more than the bush administrations 12.5 % increase in federal spending . s2 was basing that on __s1__ 's previous statement in other words , anything that is opposed to one wing must be the opposite so s2 don t see how it s absurd unless __s1__ want to call __s1__ 's original statement absurd . this is obviously not the thread for this discussion but s2 will reply this time and see where it takes us . __s1__ __didn__ t state what __s1__ considered to be numerous nor did __s1__ supply anything to back up that statement . however deficits depend on both increased spending and lower revenues . bush has done both with large tax cuts and large discretionary spending increases . and even the conservatives are beginning to criticize him for being a big spending president . over the past 23 years , conservative administrations have increased the deficits and liberal administrations have decreased the deficits . so yeah it looks to me like left wing is against deficits and right wing is for deficits .
ref_sum ->  two people are debating the topic of gay marriage rights . __s1__ believes allowing gays to marry will open up the door to legalize other types of marriage such as polygamy . s2 holds to the theory that if king david was able to have multiple wives , why then should the common man not be able to , especially if religion is to now be the basis for all laws . __s1__ contends that practice was of the old testament and is no longer considered commonplace . s2 feels __s1__ is too left wing to entertain the thought of allowing gay marriage , but uses religion as the basis even though there are so many contradictions between the old testament and what is considered the new testament .
generated -> some opposition to the petition ... more left wing ideology at work . if the man after god s own heart had multiple wives , why can t i ? have heard others say that we already have polygamy in america that

Article ->  __s1__ think a better comparison is __sodom__ ... . these are the comments that make __s1__ a homophobic bigot , not __s1__ 's opposition to gay marriage . in s2 's mind yes ... . when s2 have bath houses in sf that have 100 men in a daisy chain performing unprotected sex on one another __s1__ would make the comparison to __sodom__ ... . that is not homophobic , that is a fact and s2 should condemn it too ... . so , __s1__ have been there to see this s2 take it or are __s1__ going on rumors and misinformation . did __s1__ read about this on the focus on family website ? sorry , s2 just do n't believe you . go to yahoo and do a search on san francisco gay bath houses if s2 do n't believe me ... . when the aids first came out they were shut down but they are flourishing again now and the occupants have gone back to unprotected sex ... . from what __s1__ have surmised s2 are gay . __s1__ am surprised s2 did not know that ... . you made a very specific claim about 100 men in a daisy chain having unprotected sex . it is clear to me that post was not based in fact , but opinion . if __s1__ do n't have the proof of the claim , __s1__ should n't make it ! that is what makes __s1__ a __homophobe__ . __s1__ make claims about gays without knowing the truth . why do s2 think they closed the bath houses down in the eighties ? this , at last check is 2005 , what they did in the 80 's has nothing to do with the topic at hand , or __s1__ 's comments . so either justify __s1__ 's comments or take them back and admit they were __uncalled__ for ... joe s2 need to read the link __s1__ cited in a post in this thread ... . gays in sf are trying to get the bath houses reopened ... . great ! what does that have to do with gay rights ? what does it have to do with the title of this thread ? how can __s1__ take what a small group of gays in california are doing and equate it to the behaviors of all gays . that is irresponsible .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ is against gay rights apparently because of the biblical story of __sodom__ , and the sexual activities __s1__ perceives to have occurred in san francisco bath houses , which __s1__ asserts the current gay community is trying to re-open . he argues that the gay community is going back to unprotected sex and that a daisy chain of 100 men perform unprotected sex on each other in the bath houses . s2 challenges the assumptions , specifically finding the daisy chain of 100 men a less than credible assertion and !!__admonishes__!! __s1__ to use facts to support his arguments , not opinions . s2 also notes that __s1__ 's apparent fascination with bath houses is not relevant to the gay rights topic under which the posts are being entered .

Article ->  __s1__ will take this one ... . please do n't compare a race of peoples fight for equal rights to a class of people determined by their sexual __oreintation__ ... . it is and insult to all african americans ... . yep , coretta scott king and __jullian__ bond are against gay rights ? __s1__ did say '' all african americans '' . we are talking about gay marriage ... . can cite a link where they say they are for gay marriage ? already been done , , , , several times . __s1__ did not think s2 could do it ... . julian bond coretta scott king thank you , __s1__ will amend __s1__ 's statement to most african americans ... . __s1__ wonder how rev mlk felt about the issue ... . he has much more __creditabilty__ to me then either of 's examples ... . s2 guess no one will ever know for sure .
ref_sum ->  prior to this dialog , s2 apparently likened the gay marriage movement to the civil rights movement of the african american community . __s1__ is offended by the alleged analogy , finding a material distinction between race and sexual orientation . she suggests that to view it otherwise would be an insult to all african americans . s2 points out that two presumably prominent african american figures , !!__corretta__!! scott king and __jullian__ bond , are !!__pro-gay__!! marriage . __s1__ questions whether they do in fact support gay marriage , and s2 provides links to support his assertion . __s1__ accepts the evidence and concedes that some african americans may not be as insulted by the analogy and wonders how martin luther king felt about the issue of gay marriage .
generated -> yep , coretta scott king and jullian bond are against gay rights . s1 did say '' all african americans `` '' we are for gay marriage ? we are talking about gay marriage ``

Article ->  agreed , when the husband is part of a __hetero__ relationship . gay husband is not a legally recognized category . agreed , when the wife is part of a __hetero__ relationship . gay wife is not a legally recognized category . agreed , when the spouse is part of a __hetero__ relationship . gay spouse is not a legally recognized category . so the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem . what is the reason it 's not legally recognized ? because the couple is gay . where do __s1__ get the figure of 500,000 gay couples who want to immediately be married ? would these gay couples beat the straight couples in some kind of a race to the weddings occurring at the same time , or occurring over the course of a month or a year ? they are not legally recognized because they do n't meet the legal criteria for marriage , ie one man , one woman . a cat does n't meet the legal definition of a dog . do we change the definition of dog to appease the cat ? that 's the real question to be answered by society . actually , __s1__ pulled the number out of the air for __illustrative__ purposes only , but after reading the cbo report , __s1__ see that __s1__ was n't far off . they predicted 600,000 gay couples would want to get married it allowed . this is circular reasoning however . it 's stating that marriage simply is heterosexual , and so completely ends debate . exactly __s1__ 's point , just as a cat can never be considered a dog just because someone wants it to be . to me , and __s1__ is guessing millions of others , the term gay marriage is an __oxymoron__ . that 's not to say that we should n't consider the possibility of allowing gay unions with , possibly , equivalent rights to __hetero__ couples if we , as a society , see the benefit in doing so . for example , prior to fdr , the concept of state welfare was considered ludicrous and unconstitutional , but he was able to get enough support -lrb- and enough political muscle -rrb- to change society 's mind on the role of the federal gov ' t once he demonstrated the '' good '' that doing so had on america in its most dire time of need . people were willing to sacrifice a little freedom for security just as ben franklin had warned against . now , i 'll be the first to tell s2 that __s1__ think fdr was the biggest threat to american freedom that ever existed , but one ca n't argue his ability to change public opinion on the role of the federal gov ` t . it concerns reason , as __jaxian__ said earlier . what are the logical reasons for marriage discrimination against gays and lesbians ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ does not believe that anyone outside of a heterosexual marriage should be considered a husband , wife or a spouse because legally they are not . this person believes that the term gay marriage is an __oxymoron__ because marriage , legally , to them , is only between one man and one woman . they believe that prior to roosevelt , society did not accept the idea of state welfare as constitutional , but because people were willing to sacrifice freedom for security , they eventually caved to his ideas . s2 does not believe that marriage is simply between one man and one woman , and that the entire reason behind the debate is so that homosexual marriage can and will be legally recognized . they do not see a reason for discrimination against homosexual marriage .
generated -> s1 pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only , but after reading the cbo report , s1 see that s1 was n't far off . it 's stating that marriage simply is heterosexual , and so completely ends debate that

ref_sum ->  __s1__ does not believe that most christians are trying to ban homosexual unions , and that those accusing them of doing so are doing so falsely . they believe that homosexual lobbyists have gone beyond being defensive and are actively attempting to attack evangelical !!__christiandom__!! falsely in order to justify their arguments . s2 believes that the majority of __self-identified__ christians in the united states in fact , do oppose civil unions for homosexual citizens . however , they point out that in other countries such as spain , they might not , but in general , the belief is the same globally . they refute __s1__ 's claims that they are not trying to ban homosexual unions by pointing out that the state constitutional amendments being passed are intended to preclude same-sex marriage and civil unions .

ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that the number of earthquakes occurring outside of israel has increased in the last hundred years , comparing 20 large earthquakes in the latter half of the 20th century to only 15 large earthquakes in the first half of the 20th century , and only 7 large earthquakes in the entire 19th century . __s1__ argues that this information is clear evidence that the frequency of earthquakes is increasing over time . s2 refutes __s1__ claim of increasing earthquake frequency , suggesting that the greater number of earthquakes detected could be a matter of increases in our ability to detect earthquakes rather than an actual increase in the number of earthquakes occurring . __s1__ takes this point into consideration , but claims that the evidence still supports his original claim .
generated -> obviously we do n't have the smae understanding of the us government . if s1 have a better understanding of love waxing cold s1 had like to hear it . if s1 can point out how that is n't true then s1 had be interested in being enlightened that

Article ->  __s1__ 's __apologizies__ . __s1__ read it hastily and got it completely __bassackwards__ . the cbo estimate in 's link did , indeed , say that the result would be up to ~ $ 1 billion surplus . so __s1__ also recognize that __s1__ 's argument that same-sex marriage does not benefit society is also '' __bassackwards__ '' ? finally ! some progress . remember ... this thread is supposed to be about fiscal concerns . __s1__ have conceded that it does n't have the negative financial impact that __s1__ thought it would . that was the purpose for __s1__ 's attempting to have a civil debate on what __s1__ thought the issues were . __s1__ had like to move past the fiscal concerns and onto the moral and health concerns if we can continue to do s2 with civility . gosh , s2 love a good typo ! in any case , s2 suppose a tepid concession is all we can expect . good catch . and s2 were hoping for ... ? a forthright concession . any maybe some discussion of how same-sex marriage benefits society in practical ways . instead , we are off to __s1__ 's safe ground of '' morality '' . safe , not because __s1__ are right , but because morality is relative and is subjective . __s1__ was hoping that s2 had be telling me the benefits , not vice versa . but s2 forget , __s1__ is not one of '' those '' who feels the need to impose __s1__ 's morality on everyone else . __s1__ is more than willing to let society as a whole determine its own limits . while __s1__ is a staunch defender of the constitution -lrb- as written , not as interpreted -rrb- , __s1__ is way more flexible with public determined acceptable standards of behavior . i 'll even cut __s1__ 's grass so that it is the same level as __s1__ 's neighbors .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ concedes that there would be little financial impact on support for homosexual marriage , and would in fact supply a surplus . however , this person still desires a debate on moral and health concerns of the issue . they do not view themselves as someone who imposes their moral beliefs on others , and is willing to let society determine its own limits . while they vocally defend the united states constitution as written , they also desire to be more flexible with public determined acceptance of behavior . s2 would like to see this concession as a means to lead to a discussion on the societal benefits of same-sex marriage , however , they believe that __s1__ is attempting to hide behind their moral grounds because __s1__ sees it as relative and subjective .
generated -> s1 's apologizies read it does n't have the negative financial impact that s1 's argument that same-sex marriage does not have the negative financial impact that s1 's argument that same-sex marriage does not have the negative financial impact that s1 thought the issues were .

Article ->  should they ? what are western standards ? what were they 20 yrs ago ? what were they 100 yrs ago ? marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract . where would that put families started by artificial insemination ? the same as any other heterosexual couple . it 's not the way children are created -lrb- adopted , __serrogacy__ , etc -rrb- . it ' s the nature of the relationship -lrb- heterosexual -rrb- . natural refers to nature not child bearing . which god enforces marriage rules when the __cermony__ is __performend__ by a judge ? there was a tribe in the congo that allowed it . their __shamans__ told them that the warriors could only marry outer warriors . to be with a women , they thought , might make then softer , and more woman like , and not as fearless in combat . ok , so conceiving a child is not what makes it nature , what is it ? __wouldn__ t polygamy also include some of that same sex taboo , to women marred together ? why do __s1__ feel __s1__ 's values are right and others that disagree as wrong ? polygamy is not women married together . it 's one man or women married to multiple of the opposite sex like a harem or entourage . everyone feels their values are right or else they would n't believe in them . what we value shows . of course atheist do n't believe in god so they have a different set of values . __s1__ of course believe in god first , family second , and country third . if s2 have different values then of course s2 will think yours are better if not then s2 would n't have them . our values are what guide us . __s1__ feel that from perspective __s1__ 's values give someone a better balance and stability to function in society . s2 probably think otherwise but __s1__ feel statistically __s1__ can support mine . sorry , s2 don t practice polygamy ; s2 don t know the inner workings of the family . s2 would think it would be a good way for __bi-sexual__ to stay below the radar . s2 worded the question badly ; s2 should have asked why do __s1__ feel that __s1__ 's morals should be forced on to others ? by keeping the laws the way they are now it is discrimination . correct me if s2 am wrong , but s2 did not think __s1__ could fire some one for being gay . it 's all good __s1__ did n't think s2 knew what s2 were talking about __anyways__ ? the questions is why should they force their moral on us ? should we let other people like nudist and rapist force their __mroals__ on us ? how is allowing them to marry forcing there morals on us ? yes we would have to deal with the fact of it , but the us has been dealing with the fact of polygamy fro years . there is only one case that was prosecuted in recent history -lrb- that was mostly due to one of his wives being 14 when married . when society __legalizes__ behavior it is in fact accepting it as __non-detrimental__ and accepting it . it is a form of forcing our society to accept the behavior .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ makes the claim that marriage is defined as a family unit based on natural heterosexual contact , and suggests that it is the heterosexual nature of the relationship that is important , not how the children are conceived within the relationship . he argues that homosexuals are attempting to force their morals on others by legalizing same-sex marriage , claiming that legalizing a behavior is a tacit form of acceptance that will affect society . s2 questions the religious basis of a civil ceremony like marriage , suggesting that the !!__stipulations__!! based on religious reasons would vary depending on the chosen religion . he also compares homosexuality to polygamy , claiming that polygamy has been unofficially accepted for years , and argues that maintaining the current same-sex marriage bans should be considered discriminatory .
generated -> marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract . where would that put families started by artificial insemination ? the same as any other heterosexual couple . which god enforces marriage rules when the cermony is performend by a judge ? there was a tribe in the congo that the warriors could only marry outer warriors .

Article ->  __duh__ ??? what do __s1__ mean by that ? -lrb- hint ; read below __s1__ 's name below . -rrb- one could only wish that modern liberalism was truly __jeffersonian__ . if it were , s2 had be a liberal too . ok . i 'll ask s2 the same question what do __s1__ mean by that ? jefferson 's views were that democracy was with power of the people . he also understood the need for war when it comes to pursuing , __perserving__ and maintaining liberty -lrb- '' the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots & tyrants . it is its natural manure '' -rrb- . he believed liberty was threatened by a consolidated , centralized government , which is radically different than liberalism today , which takes the very opposite stance , __imo__ . __decentralization__ was a big theme to jefferson . he would have opposed __over-regulation__ . liberalism today has abandoned a lot of what jefferson believed , kept what they prefer , and changed it . there are many aspects of his liberalism s2 would agree with like their focus on domestic social issues such as taking care of elderly , making sure there is fairness , freedom for black people , etc. . but liberalism as embodied today by the democratic party has become __anti-religion__ , __over-regulatory__ , and it 's been taken over by extremist special interest groups such as the gay lobby and others -lrb- much the same way the republicans were taken over by the religious right in the 80 s -rrb- . it 's a political favor game now , not honest advocacy for the people as jefferson would have had it . are not doing the exact same thing ? did perhaps mean '' would agree with '' '' making sure there is fairness '' and '' honest advocacy '' , except for gay people . ??? no , that 's why s2 support equal opportunity for people regardless of their sexual behavior . but s2 do n't support redefining the marriage standard in this country , either . oh . so '' marriage '' is only for __hetrosexual__ people who use sex only for __procreation__ only in the missionary position ?
ref_sum ->  s2 suggests that he would be liberal if modern liberalism was actually __jeffersonian__ , meaning that democracy is viewed as the power of the people . he cites jefferson 's beliefs that war can be necessary in order to maintain liberty and that centralized government is a threat , and points out how these beliefs are the opposite of modern liberalism . he further claims that the current democratic party is __anti-religion__ , __over-regulatory__ , and controlled by the gay lobby . __s1__ !!__interprets__!! s2 's argument as a claim that fairness should exist for all people except homosexuals . s2 !!__clarifies__!! that he does support equal opportunity for all people regardless of their sexual behavior , but that he is still opposed to redefining the traditional view of marriage by legalizing same-sex marriage for homosexuals .
generated -> theme to jefferson of what do s1 mean by that ? jefferson 's views were that democracy was with power of the people . he also understood the need for war when it comes to pursuing , perserving and maintaining liberty -lrb- '' the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with that jefferson 's views were that democracy was truly jeffersonian . liberalism today has abandoned a lot of what jefferson believed , kept what they prefer , and changed it .

Article ->  what about the __domionists__ ? do they care about other people or do they just care about power ? s2 just did a google search and could n't find a __dominionist__ web site at all . the only articles s2 could find on this devious organization are from radical left leaning groups that s2 believe are making this group up as a red herring to create a reason to promote fear of christians . would __s1__ be so kind as to post a link to the __dominionist__ web site that outlines their agenda to take over the country ? just go to jerry __falwell__ or pat robertson and learn what s2 need to know . so what __s1__ are saying is that __s1__ ca n't produce one objective , independent site or source that is by the __dominionists__ themselves as evidence that they are an actual existing group or organization . if __s1__ could , __s1__ would have . this is just one more example of the diabolical agenda of the radical left to make people fear christianity based on more lies and deception . thanks for revealing who the real paranoid __fearmongers__ are . do s2 's own homework , buddy . then stop making assertions __s1__ ca n't back up with evidence . s2 already told __s1__ s2 googled it and found nothing at all by a __dominionist__ organization at all . but __s1__ implied it 's a real group so prove it or else do n't attempt to use it as a method of __demonizing__ christians as a group . the reason why __s1__ __lefties__ must lie and cheat to win is because the truth is __repugnent__ and foreign to you . and __samiinh__ , it 's fascinating that __s1__ posted that article but declined to post the link . how corrupt are __s1__ to with hold the link because it 's from a leftist site that os promoting the lie of the __dominionist__ 's existence without producing any more proof than __s1__ did . s2 could post a link on google right now asserting that all __lefties__ of the socialist , democratic party persuasion are in fact satan worshipers who sacrifice the babies they kidnap from republican christians on an alter to the devil at each full moon . posting it would n't make it true . even though on its surface it 's much more credible than __s1__ 's bogus story about christian __dominionists__ . now post a link with __s1__ 's __slanderous__ article or delete it for the lie that it is .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ suggests that a christian sect known as the __domionists__ are focused only on gaining power , citing jerry __falwell__ and pat robertson as his sources . s2 claims that he was unable to find any evidence of __domionists__ practices online except from left wing groups . he suggests that the !!__dimionists__!! are not a real religious group , but rather are a group invented by left wing groups to make people fear christianity , and further argues that left leaning individuals rely on lying to achieve their goals because they are unfamiliar with the truth . he also presents an absurd story about people on the political left being satan worshipers in order to demonstrate how posting information without evidence to back it up does not make it automatically true .
generated -> the only articles s2 could find on this devious organization are from radical left leaning groups that s2 believe are making this group up as a red herring to create a reason to promote fear of christians . would s1 be so kind as to post a link to the dominionist web site that outlines their agenda to take over the country ?

Article ->  we do n't just benefit from what is often considered the common , nuclear family . we benefit from families with adopted children , step children , families with no children at all . no it does not . prove it will come up , and also prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . marriage is that now . s2 are right , it has nothing to do with the bible . it has everything to do with the slippery slope logical __fallacy__ , which we have discussed in the forum ad __nauseum__ . it only shows that those opposed do not have an argument . s2 know the prospect of incest and polygamy is much less socially acceptable than gay marriage , so s2 try to erroneously tie polygamy and incest to gay marriage in people 's mind to strike fear in them , and hope their logical reasoning can be replaced by irrational fear . a married couple as the head of a home is considered a nuclear family it already has . the question of legality is what this whole issue is about . marriage is a legal __instituation__ , how could legality not come up . yes it is whoa ... hold up ... are __s1__ saying that only because gay marriage is less unacceptable that incestuous relations , that its ok to grant gay marriage but not sibling marriage ?? if the incestuous society begin to parade and protest , until society accepts them on the level that they accept gays now , what will __s1__ say then ? on what grounds should we discriminate against 2 siblings wanting to get married , particularly if they believe they truly love each other , or if they believe that they were born with that attraction ? this is classic __hypocracy__ . if 2 siblings want to love each other in their private lives , how is that any business of yours ? and what does irrational fear have to do with anything ? do __s1__ have an irrational fear of an incestuous or polygamous lifestyle ? based on what ? give me one reason why society __shouldnt__ accept an incestuous relation between two consenting adults then what may lead to incest and polygamy is the fact that marriage is a legal institution , is that what s2 are saying ? if so , these things may come up equally as a result of straight legal marriage or gay legal marriage or interracial legal marriage , or legal __inter-faith__ marriage or legal marriage with legal divorce , etc. . it does n't relate specifically to gay legal marriage at all . __s1__ was saying this is how many people attempt an argument against gay marriage , by attempting to incite fear by spouting off a parade of __horribles__ that have nothing to do with the issue of gay marriage . what if straight people are married and winged green monkeys come flying out of everyone 's derriere in the future ? what will s2 do then ? demonstrate how gay marriage specifically relates to incest and incestuous marriage and polygamy . this is the gay rights forum , not the incest forum . thats not what im saying . what may lead to incestuous marriage is if siblings or related people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . and what may lead to polygamous marriage is 3 or more people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . do __s1__ see a pattern here ? __ooooh__ . . nice way to snake out of the issue ... let me refresh __s1__ 's memory since __s1__ brought it up , what exactly does the social acceptance of any type of '' taboo '' relationship have to do with their right to be legally married ? is there a certain limit of '' __tabooness__ '' , and if __youre__ past that limit then no marriage for you ? and what fear are __s1__ talking about ? s2 is talking about people that love each other and want to tie the knot . how could that possibly strike fear in somebody ? please ... . yes , that 's true . yes , that 's true . are s2 saying love is the pattern ? well , love applies to straight marriages as well as gay marriages . love is not exclusive to gay marriages . if that 's the connection , we can just as easily say straight marriage will lead to incestuous marriage and polygamy . s2 are saying love will cause a slippery slope . it 's still __fallacious__ . the issue __s1__ brought up was why this __fallacy__ is often used , that is to create fear , because incest and polygamy are indeed considered so taboo . the issue is not the __tabooness__ of anything and everything , but how it is being used to distract from the issue of same-sex marriage , when there is n't a logical , rational argument against same-sex marriage . it 's an indication of desperation on the part of some of those who are against same-sex marriage . __s1__ have no reason to discuss the level of __acceptability__ or lack thereof of every single thing , before __s1__ accept one thing that is different from all those other things . __s1__ can deal with that one thing on all of its own merits and shortfalls , without being drawn into a false dilemma , either accept everything or else do n't accept one thing , as if those are the only two choices , __fallacy__ . gay marriage will change the definition of marriage from '' a legal union between a man and a woman '' to '' a legal union between any parties that love each other '' . if its ok for 2 people that love each other and want to tie the knot , then how could incest be a taboo ? based on what ? again with the double standard . gay marriage was considered just as much a taboo as incest or polygamy just a few years ago . being gay emerged from its taboo status through parades , promotional efforts , and , unfortunately , by spreading lies -lrb- i 'll deal with that in another thread -rrb- . however , incestuous people __didnt__ go through the process of parading their lifestyle in front of the world and practically begging for approval from society . so incest is still deeper in taboo status than homosexuality . why is it ok to deny incestuous relations the right to marry on the grounds that it is considered taboo , but ok to approve gay marriage on the same grounds ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are debating whether making gay marriage legal will open opportunities for other `` taboos '' in our society . __s1__ believes that in opening this opportunity for gay marriage , the definition of marriage will change and it will allow other issues like incest and polygamy to become legal . s2 accuses __s1__ of __hypocracy__ . in a sense , they believe gay marriage will have a sort of domino effect for other issues . __s1__ is arguing that using these other issues to be evidence for why !!__gay-marriage__!! should n't be allowed is not a valid argument . then __s1__ goes on to say that this tactic is used to instill fear to those who do not support those other issues . __s1__ understands the other issues , but does n't see the relationship between those and that of same-sex marriage . s2 keeps arguing that it __shouldnt__ be different figuring out whether one can approve gay marriage but not incest since they believe the two to be somewhat related .
generated -> prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . marriage is that now , and prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . it has everything to do with the slippery slope logical fallacy , which we have discussed in the forum ad nauseum .

Article ->  do n't __s1__ think that in 1909 it was probably viewed mostly from a moral standpoint ? __s1__ do n't think they saw it the same way they would see black people . they did n't even realize that ' homosexuality ' was any sort of innate thing . it was entirely behavioral to them . __s1__ tend to agree with the court , even given what __s1__ have said . __s1__ doubt for 1909 it was about prejudice and bigotry -- they genuinely felt it was wrong . the concept of gay marriage was completely foreign and unknown in 1909 . it was n't even something they conceived of . __s1__ think the court is saying that they could n't have been prejudiced against something they did n't even know of or conceive of . __hogwash__ . it was once entirely moral to believe certain races were inferior , and that women had fewer rights than men . treating the races and women as equal was not something even thought of by many . it was prejudice against gays then , and it still is today . this is not really true . it 's a popular __misconstruing__ of morality and history by proponents of modern ' rights ' movements , but it 's not true . there 's little historical backing to the idea that people believed __oppressing__ black people was a right thing to do , as in , doing good . there were times they used an argument where religion was wrongly used to justify their behavior , but that 's a different matter . if s2 firmly believe otherwise , __s1__ had challenge s2 to show where people thought __oppressing__ blacks was an example if doing good . the same goes for misogyny . furthermore , it 's beside the point anyway . we are talking about homosexuality . in 1909 , the only thing they really understood about the issue at hand was that some people engaged in sexual relations with people of their own gender . there were no articles about '' homosexuality '' as a trait , and certainly none about genetic causes . it was understood entirely from a behavioral standpoint , and therefore a moral standpoint . so it 's not __hogwash__ at all -- they really did view gay sex as immoral . if s2 do n't think so , then s2 have a very poor grasp on history in this case . this kind of morality is based on nothing but ignorance -lrb- which __s1__ admit -rrb- and prejudice . what kind of a basis is that for a so-called moral code ? so what if it involves behaviour ? gay people have sex , develop relationships , and bond , just like everyone else , but in a way that reflects their gay sexuality . this does not mean people could not be prejudiced about the way gay people live . people were , and are so prejudiced . a better reverse analogy would have been to say '' so then __conversly__ __s1__ have the right to advocate that heterosexual relations are morally wrong '' . not __heterosexuality__ , since it 's not homosexuality -lrb- as it 's a state of being -rrb- that religious people have a problem with . heck , they often do n't even recognize it . with that caveat , yes s2 are certainly free to advocate whatever s2 want to be morally wrong . -lrb- and unlike the way some in s2 's movement do , __s1__ wo n't call s2 a '' bigot '' for doing so ! -rrb- it may have been based on '' ignorance '' , but __s1__ reject the notion it was based on prejudice -lrb- and therefore __s1__ tend to agree with the 6 - 0 view of the justices here -rrb- . the 1909 society had too little understanding of gay people to be prejudiced over in the first place . remember , homosexuality was not understood as a state of being at that time . the term itself had not been around long and was not known to most people . and even to those it was known to , it was not known as a state of being . and there certainly was no social identity among gay people as a group -- how could prejudice have existed if there was nothing -lrb- from their perspective -rrb- to be prejudiced toward ? right . provided gays do n't live gay , but live straight , gays can be as gay as they want . as long as gays do n't outwardly show what makes them different from __straights__ , gays can be as gay as they want . it 's bs . also some may not recognize the existence of gay people or their gay lives , but that is putting one 's head in the sand . nonsense . people would widely and __hatefully__ use the term '' __sodomite__ '' to refer to gays . before that the term was '' molly '' . clearly there was an identity they were prejudiced towards . they were rounding up gays in areas they were known to attend , and putting them in prison . read up on the trial of oscar wilde . gays may have been forced underground , to a greater extent , but that does not mean they were not thought of . gays were just not thought of in a nice way . gays were purposely kept out of everything in society , when society did n't really think of gays as human too . that is n't prejudice ? because they did n't approve of sodomy ! do s2 not agree they did n't understand the concept of homosexuality ??? there was no social identity . when they were put on trial , it was n't because they were gay -lrb- which they had no concept of -rrb- , it was because they had gay relations which society viewed as wrong ! no , here 's where s2 do n't get it -- it 's not that '' gays '' -lrb- there was no concept of that -rrb- were purposely kept out of of everything , it 's that people who had sodomy relationships were kept out of everything , because sodomy was viewed as wrong . they really did think it was wrong ! s2 are so determined to portray everything that has anything to do with gay relations possibly being wrong as prejudice and bigotry that s2 are __close-minded__ about it .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : in 1909 , being homosexual was morally wrong , and people could be prejudiced about something that they did not recognize as innate . there was little historical evidence to prove that people in 1909 believed that it was `` right '' or `` good '' to !!__oppress__!! black people or women , and this sentiment extend to homosexuals . in 1909 , people knew that gay sex occurred and they understood its occurrence to be entirely behavioral , and therefore , immoral . homosexuality was not understood as a social identity back then , so there was no `` gay lifestyle '' to be prejudiced against . sodomy was criminalized , not being gay . s2 : there was prejudice against gays in 1909 just as there is now . the !!__immorality__!! of homosexuality in 1909 is based on ignorance . as long as gay people `` lived straight '' , they could be as sexually !!__non-normative__!! as they wanted to be . there were terms for gay men back then , like !!__sodomite__!! and molly , so there was a clear identity for people to be prejudiced against . men who `` acted gay '' were punished for it in 1909 .

ref_sum ->  this is about the use of arguments of violence towards !!__gay-marriage__!! . __s1__ starts off saying there is a difference between being anti-gay and someone condoning violence against gay people . s2 talks about how violence is used to make people feel threatened to feel a certain way about a topic or debate . s2 used the example of kids being taught about gay marriage in school as a threat . s2 also mentions someone named archie who posts include a variety of slurs towards gay people . __s1__ brushes on the topic , but goes off track from the topic quite a bit . these two people start referring to each others `` attacks '' on each other towards the end . __s1__ says they were referring to !!__namecalling__!! and violence from the original post that was opposing gay rights . these two are n't really in opposite !!__positions/beliefs__!! , but they are more trying to discuss the ways they argue for or against gay marriage and how it may be portrayed by others .

Article ->  well ... so far eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue have found that barring same-sex marriage is unconstitutional . we are waiting to hear about three or four more . as for the nature of marriage , it is both a legal contract and -lrb- sometimes -rrb- a religious ceremony -lrb- sacrament in some religions -rrb- . we are stuck with the __duality__ , whether we like it or not , and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect . different religions can do what they want . they found that it violated their state __constitutions__ , right ? this has nothing to do with the us constitution . the winning arguments were based largely on state constitutional provisions that closely parallel , if not outright __mimmick__ , the federal constitution . that 's not generally true , is it ? for example , the massachusetts ruling was based on a specific provision in the mass. constitution that prohibits discrimination based on sexual preference . there 's nothing like that in the us constitution . and s2 's overall point was that we should be careful when calling something '' unconstitutional '' , in that we should be clear it we are talking state or federal constitution . many state __constitutions__ guarantee rights that are n't in the __fedral__ constitution . there 's nothing like that in the mass. . constitution either . though , it 's a __darned__ good idea ! goodrich was decided on equal protection grounds , citing the mass. document . __s1__ had have to look up the others to see the exact reasoning , but they are not likely to be far afield from the bedrock principles of equal protection and due process . gay rights is a real test of our constitutional system , and , so far , we are not passing with flying colors ... __s1__ are right , s2 __misremembered__ . it 's just __descrimination__ based on sex that 's banned .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing the issue of marriage equality . both subjects seem to be on the fence with the issue . __s1__ cites that eight of nine supreme courts have contended same sex marriage to be unconstitutional . s2 questions how gay marriage would violate someone 's constitutional rights . __s1__ advises the bulk of the arguments were based on state __constitutions__ which mirror the federal constitution . s2 uses the example of massachusetts ' allowing gay marriage under its state constitutional law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation . __s1__ contends there is no such piece to the massachusetts constitution . s2 then concedes he was incorrect about the citing and the law actually banned only discrimination based on gender and not sexual orientation .
generated -> marriage , it is both a legal contract and -lrb- sometimes -rrb- a religious ceremony -lrb- sacrament in some religions -rrb- , whether we like it or not , and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect . the winning arguments were based on state constitutional provisions that closely parallel , if not outright mimmick , the federal constitution .

Article ->  do n't __s1__ think that in 1909 it was probably viewed mostly from a moral standpoint ? __s1__ do n't think they saw it the same way they would see black people . they did n't even realize that ' homosexuality ' was any sort of innate thing . it was entirely behavioral to them . __s1__ tend to agree with the court , even given what __s1__ have said . __s1__ doubt for 1909 it was about prejudice and bigotry -- they genuinely felt it was wrong . the concept of gay marriage was completely foreign and unknown in 1909 . it was n't even something they conceived of . __s1__ think the court is saying that they could n't have been prejudiced against something they did n't even know of or conceive of . __hogwash__ . it was once entirely moral to believe certain races were inferior , and that women had fewer rights than men . treating the races and women as equal was not something even thought of by many . it was prejudice against gays then , and it still is today . this is not really true . it 's a popular __misconstruing__ of morality and history by proponents of modern ' rights ' movements , but it 's not true . there 's little historical backing to the idea that people believed __oppressing__ black people was a right thing to do , as in , doing good . there were times they used an argument where religion was wrongly used to justify their behavior , but that 's a different matter . if s2 firmly believe otherwise , __s1__ had challenge s2 to show where people thought __oppressing__ blacks was an example if doing good . the same goes for misogyny . furthermore , it 's beside the point anyway . we are talking about homosexuality . in 1909 , the only thing they really understood about the issue at hand was that some people engaged in sexual relations with people of their own gender . there were no articles about '' homosexuality '' as a trait , and certainly none about genetic causes . it was understood entirely from a behavioral standpoint , and therefore a moral standpoint . so it 's not __hogwash__ at all -- they really did view gay sex as immoral . if s2 do n't think so , then s2 have a very poor grasp on history in this case . this kind of morality is based on nothing but ignorance -lrb- which __s1__ admit -rrb- and prejudice . what kind of a basis is that for a so-called moral code ? so what if it involves behaviour ? gay people have sex , develop relationships , and bond , just like everyone else , but in a way that reflects their gay sexuality . this does not mean people could not be prejudiced about the way gay people live . people were , and are so prejudiced . a better reverse analogy would have been to say '' so then __conversly__ __s1__ have the right to advocate that heterosexual relations are morally wrong '' . not __heterosexuality__ , since it 's not homosexuality -lrb- as it 's a state of being -rrb- that religious people have a problem with . heck , they often do n't even recognize it . with that caveat , yes s2 are certainly free to advocate whatever s2 want to be morally wrong . -lrb- and unlike the way some in s2 's movement do , __s1__ wo n't call s2 a '' bigot '' for doing so ! -rrb- it may have been based on '' ignorance '' , but __s1__ reject the notion it was based on prejudice -lrb- and therefore __s1__ tend to agree with the 6 - 0 view of the justices here -rrb- . the 1909 society had too little understanding of gay people to be prejudiced over in the first place . remember , homosexuality was not understood as a state of being at that time . the term itself had not been around long and was not known to most people . and even to those it was known to , it was not known as a state of being . and there certainly was no social identity among gay people as a group -- how could prejudice have existed if there was nothing -lrb- from their perspective -rrb- to be prejudiced toward ? right . provided gays do n't live gay , but live straight , gays can be as gay as they want . as long as gays do n't outwardly show what makes them different from __straights__ , gays can be as gay as they want . it 's bs . also some may not recognize the existence of gay people or their gay lives , but that is putting one 's head in the sand . nonsense . people would widely and __hatefully__ use the term '' __sodomite__ '' to refer to gays . before that the term was '' molly '' . clearly there was an identity they were prejudiced towards . they were rounding up gays in areas they were known to attend , and putting them in prison . read up on the trial of oscar wilde . gays may have been forced underground , to a greater extent , but that does not mean they were not thought of . gays were just not thought of in a nice way . gays were purposely kept out of everything in society , when society did n't really think of gays as human too . that is n't prejudice ? because they did n't approve of sodomy ! do s2 not agree they did n't understand the concept of homosexuality ??? there was no social identity . when they were put on trial , it was n't because they were gay -lrb- which they had no concept of -rrb- , it was because they had gay relations which society viewed as wrong ! no , here 's where s2 do n't get it -- it 's not that '' gays '' -lrb- there was no concept of that -rrb- were purposely kept out of of everything , it 's that people who had sodomy relationships were kept out of everything , because sodomy was viewed as wrong . they really did think it was wrong ! s2 are so determined to portray everything that has anything to do with gay relations possibly being wrong as prejudice and bigotry that s2 are __close-minded__ about it .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : in 1909 , being homosexual was morally wrong , and people could be prejudiced about something that they did not recognize as innate . there was little historical evidence to prove that people in 1909 believed that it was `` right '' or `` good '' to !!__oppress__!! black people or women , and this sentiment extend to homosexuals . in 1909 , people knew that gay sex occurred and they understood its occurrence to be entirely behavioral , and therefore , immoral . homosexuality was not understood as a social identity back then , so there was no `` gay lifestyle '' to be prejudiced against . sodomy was criminalized , not being gay . s2 : there was prejudice against gays in 1909 just as there is now . the !!__immorality__!! of homosexuality in 1909 is based on ignorance . as long as gay people `` lived straight '' , they could be as sexually !!__non-normative__!! as they wanted to be . there were terms for gay men back then , like !!__sodomite__!! and molly , so there was a clear identity for people to be prejudiced against . men who `` acted gay '' were punished for it in 1909 .

Article ->  matt , this is getting ridiculous . s2 made an assertion that republicans would send gays to concentration camps like the germans did in the holocaust . then s2 brought up a statement by paul cameron , as if paul cameron has anything to do whatsoever with republican politics or leadership . now if s2 had linked someone in the republican leadership saying those things , s2 might have something , but s2 did n't . paul cameron is a psychologist that has gone over the top at times with some of the things he 's said about gays and has paid a price for it . he 's a frequent target of the gay pride movement for __demonization__ and because he did n't tow the line with the apa 's political stances , they distanced themselves from him . __s1__ do n't agree with everything he says either , for that matter . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking ; the most s2 can say is that they are paul cameron talking . well , sure -- anything could happen . a military coup could take place and we had have martial law . a new ice age could start in the next year . an asteroid could be on its way to hit earth . but there 's a big difference between possibility and likelihood . paul cameron is the single most frequently quoted '' expert '' cited by the gop in all their attempts to limit the rights of gay people . his '' research '' has been entered in the congressional record countless times . it really is astounding that anyone would have anything to do with him . including you . what price ? without his revolting beliefs and __star-power__ , he had be flipping burgers somewhere . instead , he 's raking in a fortune speaking to the '' moral '' groups __s1__ are constantly defending . he was dismissed from the group for conducting fraudulent research . cameron talking ... gop repeating . seriously , __jyoshu__ , the man called for extermination . how can __s1__ support him or cite him or defend him at all __??????__ how can s2 not stay on point ? unless cameron is a part of the gop __leadeship__ , matt is pulling some wild point out of his hat , saying that because someone who may not even be a republican hates gays , that republicans hate gays . __s1__ might as well have said that since john lennon attacked religion , then democrats hate religion . yes , his comments are that ludicrous . this is not about paul cameron no matter how much s2 had love to change the subject , it 's about matt 's ridiculous __generalizations__ and comments . oh , and s2 need to get up with the times -- no national political party has used cameron 's information in a serious way in a long time . __s1__ is sure you 'll now be googling to try and find republican individuals out there on the internet citing cameron , but that 's not the party leadership or its platform . there is no republican in leadership that would call for the extermination of gays , and s2 know it . nor does the platform say so . so let 's put that little lie to bed right now . sorry , sir . since __s1__ did n't stay on point , s2 thought others were just as free to wander . if democratic legislators from sea to shining sea quoted lennon 's lyrics about '' imagine no religion '' at every session that talked about religious freedom , __s1__ might draw that conclusion , no ? __ooops__ . s2 thought it was about a conservative democrat in minnesota bragging about '' inside information '' from that state 's supreme court . uh ... how about the president of the united states ??? paul cameron 's research is cited in virtually every single attack on gay people in state after state after state legislature . it was presented in the '' debate '' about same-sex marriage in the u.s. __friggin__ ' senate . his name appears in the citations of virtually every legal brief filed by opponents of same-sex marriage . __http__ think he even made it into lawrence v. texas . the man is president of the family research institute . he can probably phone up ol ' __dubya__ anytime he gets the urge . and __dubya__ will put down his pretzel and pick up the phone . what should be put to bed is paul cameron and every single bogus study related to him . that supposedly reasonable people would even mention his name is surprising . ok , __s1__ now realize something __s1__ did n't earlier -- that __http__ are obviously a dnc __shill__ . no one else would make such a ridiculous __generalization__ . __http__ really do think that 's all conservatives talk about , huh ? __s1__ hate to bust __http__ 's bubble , but it 's not . __s1__ know __http__ 's martyr complex is important to you , but it 's just not accurate . -lrb- shrug -rrb- what are __s1__ talking about ? s2 said __s1__ had probably be right to assume that some people were __anti-religion__ if they consistently talked about what a wonderful world it would be without it ? over and over . at every opportunity . and never had a single nice word to say about it . ever . __s1__ really are laughable when __s1__ try to defend the gop when one of their admittedly most effective propaganda campaigns is to rally the '' __family-values__ '' crowd against gay rights . it 's openly admitted by them . they are proud of their tactics . very odd ...
ref_sum ->  this seems to be an argument about gay rights and !!__generalizing__!! the political beliefs of people . according to __s1__ , s2 talks about paul cameron and makes it seem as if he is the voice of the republicans . __s1__ argues that it is not the case and one person who sides with a specific party does n't represent the party . __s1__ uses john lennon as an example of this not being a proper way to !!__generalize__!! political views of parties , in his case the democratic party . __s1__ accuses s2 of making an assertion including the republicans creating another holocaust , because of the !!__generalization__!! that s2 made . s2 believes that paul cameron 's views are cited and used in many cases against gay rights because most people do share the same views , which __s1__ thinks otherwise . s2 says that most attacks on gay rights have cited paul cameron , even within the us senate , showing that he has a strong opinion in the republican party , or at least it seems so .

Article ->  any two adults can run the household , one can make the decision if the other is incapacitated , one inherits when the other dies , etc etc. . that parallel does not carry over to group marriages . when one dies , who inherits ? if one is __incapacitied__ , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two , so __recongnising__ group marriages is a huge legal task , and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious . if we are talking about legal recognition , and we are -lrb- right ? -rrb- , then the cases are wildly different . our marriage laws , for better or worse , are set up on the assumption of two adults running a household . they also assume man and wife , true , but do n't actually depend on that . but the dependence on there being two people is embedded in the laws ; changing that is a huge project . yes , but gays would also want laws changed to __accomodate__ their form of marriage as well . the fact that one requires less change than the other should n't matter , should it ? should having to do more __reworking__ of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality ? it seems to me __s1__ 's argument boils down to '' polygamy requires more work to make the laws __accomodate__ it . '' yeah -- such is the price for marriage equality . let 's face it -- if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for __opposite-sex__ couples which comprise most relationships , they could pull it off -- polygamy , gays , letting 17 year olds marry , etc. . all those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed . means could be set up to determine inheritance , for example . laws can be worded to do it . see , this is why we try to avoid this debate . those who oppose gay marriage inevitably put their own spin on it and drag it to silly conclusion . here we see what gays really want turned into '' make marriage an open-ended institution of equality '' , which then means gay , poly , and 17 year olds in this case . __jyoshu__ stopped there , but it 's not uncommon for it then to go to children , cousins , dogs , whatever . this issue is not '' let 's let everyone do anything they like '' , that 's just the common __reframing__ we see whenever poly relations are brought up while __disscusing__ gay marriage . it happens all the time , it gets old , and that 's why people who have gone through it a bunch of times tend to __aviod__ the whole thing . it happens because there 's no way to avoid logical conclusions . believe it or not , cultural and legal precedent is a very real thing . the events in the article __exemplify__ this . if __s1__ argue to broaden marriage -lrb- which __s1__ are -rrb- , then this is what __s1__ have to deal with . as __s1__ said , s2 did stop with polygamy , gay , and barely lowering the age of consent , so why are you bringing up all the other examples like '' children , cousins dogs , '' or whatever , as if __s1__ were ready to pounce on that ? __s1__ are arguing against degrees that s2 did n't even say , or that no one said . now , do __s1__ have any response to s2 's point that __s1__ 's argument boils down to nothing more than '' polygamy requires more work to make the laws __accomodate__ it '' , or are __s1__ just going to avoid it by getting __sidetracked__ by the fact __s1__ do n't like that we are even talking about this ? again , society can deal with issues like polygamy if they really want to . sure there is . s2 can start with an erroneous assumption , like s2 did , and then arrive at an illogical conclusion , like s2 did . why do n't s2 read the exchanges between me and phyllis ; __s1__ think most of s2 's issues will be addressed that way . do __s1__ feel that opening marriage to gay couples is not a case of broadening marriage ? how is that an erroneous assumption ? sure , but s2 asked __s1__ some specific questions that __s1__ seem to be avoiding . in __s1__ 's exchange with phyllis s2 may comment on matters s2 disagree with . listen to yourself ! we start with '' gays want to get married '' , s2 change it to '' make marriage an open-ended institution of equality '' , and now s2 __segue__ over to '' broadening marriage '' . s2 's erroneous assumption is s2 's statement of what gays are trying to accomplish . until s2 stop trying to change what gays really want into something that s2 can argue against more easily all s2 's arguments will be based on erroneous assumptions . actually , __s1__ did address them . while debating with phyllis . naturally . and naturally __s1__ may ignore them if __s1__ think they are diversions . what gays are trying or not trying -lrb- in terms of intent -rrb- is not the issue . what is the crux here is that marriage would be broadened . it 's not rocket science . __s1__ are moving the boundaries of what constitutes a marriage to include more than __opposite-sex__ couples . very straightforward . s2 know __s1__ do n't like it __phrased__ that way , but that 's what it is . __s1__ ca n't take a phrase like ' gays want to get married '' without looking at the overall implications . in terms of legal rights , s2 do n't see why it would be any different . equality in marriage is equality in marriage regardless of the cultural motivation -- religious , being in love with more than one person , or simply just for the hell of it . for that matter , the argument could be made that __opposite-sex__ marriage between 2 people is largely a religious construct ! i 'll try to explain this to s2 one more time . the stated purpose of gays is quite __relevent__ if s2 are trying to argue against it . gays want to get married . one side effect of that is that some people will see the scope of marriage broadened . gays are not , in and of itself , trying to broaden marriage . they did not wake up one day and say '' let 's try to broaden the scope of marriage today , that 'll be fun ! '' s2 's arguments run along the lines of '' if s2 want to __braoden__ marriage , than s2 must __excpet__ it broadening in all these other ways '' and that 's why s2 's __rephrasing__ does n't work . broadening marriage is n't the goal , it 's a side effect , and since it is n't the goal we do n't have to accept all these other things s2 claim would be the result if they were trying to broaden marriage . to recap , s2 's arguments are based on s2 's assumption that gays want to broaden marriage , that that is their __ulitmate__ goal , the pinnacle of the cause . gays getting married to s2 seems to be the means to that end . that is , of course , backwards , and so s2 's __sematic__ based arguments fail . __kronos__ , s2 just told __s1__ s2 am not dealing here with what gays are trying / not trying to do in terms of intent , yet __s1__ are are arguing as if s2 never even said that . s2 am not arguing what gays have as intent . s2 completely understand what __s1__ are saying . s2 's point here is based on the effect of their intents , whatever that intent is . there is simply no way to get around the fact that if __s1__ change marriage to include other that __opposite-sex__ couples -lrb- to any number of other possibilities -- even one -rrb- , __s1__ are broadening marriage . whether or not gays set out out to do this in terms of a goal is irrelevant . __s1__ are attacking some point about intent that s2 have n't made -- s2 is talking about the effect here . to latch onto some straw man of '' intent '' is to completely miss the point . __s1__ is not ignoring this post , __s1__ is simply choosing not to respond because it 's a pointless distraction in an otherwise __interesing__ thread . if s2 want to start another thread on this theme i 'll explain there how wrong s2 are . well , __s1__ are the one that 's taking issue and making it a distraction !
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : !!__opposers__!! to gay marriage often jump to conclusions about who can get married - why not cousins , group marriages , children , dogs ? polygamous marriage raises legal concerns that are not currently covered in traditional marriage laws , for example . the goal of gay marriage supporters is to be able to get married - not to broaden marriage . broadened marriage is a side effect of legal gay marriage . s2 : gay marriage supporters want marriage laws changed to accommodate gay marriage . broadened marriage could change the current traditional marriage laws . polygamy , for example , would require more marriage laws changed than gay marriage would , as more people are involved . but if enough people wanted legal polygamous marriage , the laws would be passed . marriage would be broadened if gay marriage is made legal , whether that is the goal of gay marriage or not .
generated -> if one is incapacitied , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that parallel does not carry over to group marriages . if one is incapacitied , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two , so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task , and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious that

Article ->  we all know the possibility exists . __s1__ simply have n't seen anyone present any even half way convincing argument that any of those possibilities are , in fact , a reality . all __s1__ are saying is '' they say it 's morals '' which is no argument at all . calling a tail a leg , etc. . furthermore , why do __s1__ start with the premise that it 's prejudice , rather than needing proof of that -lrb- instead expecting proof of a negative -- that it 's not -rrb- ? __s1__ did n't start with that premise , it 's simply the most likely answer . __s1__ know of no moral system that condones hurting others when said harm is n't preventing some other harm , so morals are out . religion is a good reason for choosing s2 's own actions but it 's no reason for telling others how to live , so that 's out . prejudice against gays has been around for ages , so that 's quite likely . and no other explanations come to mind . straight forward . __s1__ is sure __s1__ have explained this to s2 before , and have invited s2 to come up with alternate explanations . __s1__ do so again . __s1__ is particularly interested to see s2 's response now that s2 seem to have gotten over the idea that simply calling something moral or religious does not mean that it ca n't be prejudice at the same time . and neither does christianity . it too is a moral system . that 's why when people claim religion in their acts of prejudice , they are actually abandoning that moral system , rather than engaging in it . so yes , morals are out -- s2 is glad __s1__ are seeing that now . so s2 finally see that people can claim a moral or religious stance while not actually having one ? excellent ! glad to hear it . now , care to address the matter at hand ? can s2 show me , preferably in reality as opposed to a hypothetical , how one could justify pushing an anti-gay agenda based on actual morals or religion ? because __s1__ have never seen it myself . nice attempt at trying to refute a point that has n't even been made here . the matter at hand is that prejudice may in fact not be what 's behind people 's opposition to gays being in romantic relationships . in some cases -lrb- well , s2 had say many cases -rrb- it 's religious belief , which may be separate from prejudice . the people s2 have been around who __fel__ that way were doing it because of their religious beliefs . in fact , it 's my reason as well . actually it was __s1__ 's point . s2 have refused to acknowledge this so many times in the past that __s1__ could n't even count . __s1__ is glad s2 are past it now . fine , than if it 's s2 's reasoning than spell it out for me . do n't worry about anyone else 's reasoning , just give me yours . take me , step by step , from '' this is __s1__ 's religious belief '' to '' therefore other people should n't be gay -lrb- or act gay or whatever -rrb- '' . leave nothing out , spell out s2 's assumptions , give me the whole ball of wax . because in all __s1__ 's years __s1__ have never once seen anyone come close to doing so without resorting to prejudice . for bonus points extend it all the way to '' and so public policy __disadvantageous__ to gays should be enacted '' . s2 have never said that people ca n't claim to have a moral belief and not really have one . people can conceivably lie about anything -- we ca n't base our discussion on the worry that people might be lying about their stance ; that could be the case in any situation about any issue . no , it 's a religious belief . there 's no more '' reasoning '' to it than believing in faith that christ is a __ressurected__ being . s2 believe it because it 's biblical -- it 's what the bible says . that 's why s2 believe people should n't do it . it 's not so complicated , really . no one is saying you have to believe that way . but it is the way s2 believe , and that 's s2 's business . if s2 imposed s2 's beliefs , that would be one thing , but s2 do n't . s2 do n't impose anything on __s1__ or anyone else , nor do s2 want to . get it ? and yet __s1__ ca n't see how s2 made that jump . s2 believe , fine . but why should n't other people do it ? what do s2 's beliefs have to do with other people 's actions ? so s2 do n't impose ? s2 do n't take any action which could have an obvious negative impact on another person based solely on s2 's religious beliefs ? if that 's true than __s1__ have no problem with you , and s2 are not one of the people __s1__ is talking about here . __s1__ did specify people pushing an anti-gay agenda after all . are s2 saying that the people in '' focus on the family '' , or whatever they are called , are in fact doing wrong then ? since they are clearly trying to impose their views on others , which s2 and __s1__ seem to agree is wrong .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : religion is a good tool to guide one 's own actions , but not for telling others how to live . people have been prejudiced against homosexuals for a long time . moral or religious prejudice is still prejudice . a person can claim a moral or religious stance without having one . you can not justify an anti-gay agenda on morals or religion . an anti-gay stance on the grounds of religious belief is prejudice . prejudice based on religious belief implies that a religious person 's acts of prejudice could have a negative impact on homosexuals , because they believe that being gay is morally reprehensible . s2 : prejudice is a fact of human existence . christianity is a moral system . when people claim religion in morals , they abandon that moral system . it is religious belief - not prejudice - that makes one take an anti-gay stance . the bible says that homosexuality is wrong , so if you believe in the bible as your moral canon , then you believe that homosexuality is wrong as well .
generated -> s1 simply have n't seen anyone present any even half way convincing argument that any of those possibilities are , in fact , a reality . all s1 are saying is they say it 's morals '' which no argument at all ``

Article ->  new england and new york will probably have gay marriage within the next few years . the west coast might also follow suit after that . __s1__ think the recent wave of gay marriage legalization will stop for the next 20 years or so after that . 30 states already define marriage as between a man and a woman . do n't be so sure . if congress removes doma and with roberts and alito on the court same sex marriage will come to the rest of the country with a 7 to 2 ruling . roberts and alito are constitutional __literalists__ and with doma out of the way the full faith and credit clause is a clear constitutional mandate . can s2 demonstrate evidence that the __scotus__ would nullify gay marriage bans in all states ? if the __scotus__ was so imposed , why do n't they just strike doma down right now and then declare all gay marriage bans unconstitutional ? secondly , states can choose not to recognize gay marriage even without federal doma . there is a choice of law doctrine that allows states to not recognize other states marriages that they find '' offensive '' to their own public policy . states have been not recognizing each others marriages for decades and states do not use the __ffc__ clause to make one state recognize another 's marriage . there is no case history of __ffc__ ever used in this way . even in cases where it has been attempted , the legal argument involved is so lengthy , that it effectively prohibits __ffc__ use due to the sheer amount of hassle and legal proceedings involved in winning such a case . it is called the constitution of the united states a marriage license is a public act and record which __http__ are obviously ignorant of . __http__ completely failed to respond to the choice of law doctrine , as well as __s1__ 's request that __http__ provide justification on __http__ 's claims of how each justice would vote , as well as __s1__ 's challenge to __http__ to explain why doma has not been declared unconstitutional if __http__ 's claims about the justices were true . apparently , the law is beyond __http__ 's comprehension , as is __http__ 's ability to consider facts in forming __http__ 's opinions . in answer to __s1__ 's question . steven , kennedy , souter , ginsburg , and breyer will side with us . roberts and alito will follow the constitution as written . scalia and thomas are a lost anti gay cause . that is how s2 know how they will vote . as to why doma has not been declared unconstitutional is because there has not been a case in the courts challenging doma and so has not been taken up by __scotus__ . i 'll do a little research on s2 's claims . regardless , s2 still failed to address how state courts may use the choice of law doctrine so that the __ffc__ clause does not apply , and if it were , the sheer complication of applying the law would make it effectively prohibitive . by all means , post up the __ffc__ clause again so s2 can avoid addressing this . s2 do not see how choice of law doctrine is not trumped by the full faith and credit clause in cases of marriage contract since there is a current tradition of one state respecting other states marriage licenses when it comes to __heteros__ . the choice of law doctrine is used to settle differences between different state laws . that is how the law is practiced , and that is what courts believe . again , states have been disagreeing on the validity of each other 's marriages for decades and there has been no case history of the full faith and credit clause that has made one state recognize another state 's marriage . courts look to the choice of law doctrine before the __ff__ & c c.
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : legally , it is complicated to legalize gay marriage in all states , as doma is in place and states have chosen not to recognize other state 's marriages for decades . attempts abide by the __ffc__ clause to in respect to marriage -lrb- even before doma -rrb- require such lengthy legal arguments that they are rendered prohibitive . the choice of law doctrine must be considered and doma could be found to be unconstitutional by vote of the __scotus__ . how will states use the choice of law doctrine so that the __ffc__ clause does not apply ? s2 : if congress removes doma , a vote for legal gay marriage will pass quickly , and certain justices of __scotus__ already approve of gay marriage . doma has yet to be declared unconstitutional because there has yet to be a case made to challenge doma in the courts , so it has not been decided upon by __scotus__ . the choice of law doctrine trumps the __ffc__ clause in cases of marriage contract and there is a current tradition of respecting other states marriage licenses for .
generated -> s1 think the recent wave of gay marriage legalization will stop for the next 20 years . if congress removes doma and with roberts and alito on the court same sex marriage will come to the rest of the country with a 7 to 2 ruling . if congress removes doma and with roberts and alito on the court same sex marriage will come to the rest of the country with a 7 to 2 ruling .

Article ->  withers dc council votes for gay marriage by james withers , contributing editor , 365 gay blog __12.15.2009__ pm est in a 11 - 2 vote , the city council of washington , dc voted for gay marriage . we are a bit __short-handed__ today , so expect more about this later . until then have a sip of the bubbly and congrats to the district . wait until it 's put on a ballot for the voters to decide . this is n't the first time that a liberal government did n't pay attention to the will of the people . and what is the will of the people jp ? people in support of marriage equality is steadily growing . compare the polls from ten years ago to now to see ... it is only a matter of time before equality stands upon the side of the majority . s2 keep hearing gays say that but every time it 's put to a vote , __s1__ lose . s2 had say that it 's time to try another tact because the current one is a losing proposition . the only thing forcing gay marriage on a population does is galvanize them against the forced action . and when they respond on the ballot , they do so __punatively__ . just wait until __s1__ see the repercussions of the current efforts to give all federal employee 's same sex partners __bennies__ on our dime despite doma . s2 is guessing that some additional democratic heads will roll in the fall election if that flies . __s1__ need a pr strategy that highlights the advantages of gay unions over __bathhouse__ and gay bar __existences__ . s2 believe that a true majority of people would support civil unions but not marriage . and s2 count myself amongst that majority . actually jp so far 5 states have passed gay marriage so no not every time it is put to a vote do we lose . and how am __s1__ forcing anyone to accept gay marriage ? am __s1__ forcing these voters to attend __s1__ 's wedding or dare __s1__ say be in a marriage themselves ? and __s1__ can not agree with s2 more about changing the image of the gay community as a whole . . we are not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people running around ... what __s1__ find funny is once strait people find out how boring we really are , and how we pay taxes just like every other joe __schmo__ they 'll think nothing more of special rights lol ... but actually like __s1__ stated earlier in another thread if those unions constituted the same legal rights as married couples __s1__ would be content . which 5 states put gay marriage on the ballot and it won ? to the best of s2 's knowledge , no state that has gay marriage today has ever gotten it via the ballot . it has either been the court or legislature that has forced it on the state . the gays s2 know are as boring as mr and mrs john q. public as well , but that 's not the image that is portrayed to the general public . like s2 said , __s1__ have a pr problem . s2 think that if more gays were willing to settle for civil unions that were more equivalent to marriage , __s1__ had have an easier time gaining legal acceptance . ok maybe not the ballot ... got me there man . lol ... . maine was a close one though . and yeah we got a major pr problem big time ... and __s1__ said as long as we got the legal rights of marriage and called it __cu__ __s1__ would be cool with that . __s1__ already wear a dress and heels enough as it is ! __lmao__ jk ... . s2 hope that you , at least , shave __s1__ 's legs . __;-rrb-__ oh __s1__ do ... __lmao__ __naw__ __s1__ do n't wear a dress __s1__ would n't look good in one ...
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : washington dc ' s city council recently legalized gay marriage . people 's support of gay marriage has been growing steadily in the past ten years , and will soon be the majority opinion . five states have already legalized gay marriage . those opposed to gay marriage may view gays as promiscuous and sexual !!__deviants__!! , but most gay men are !!__assuredly__!! quite normal . civil unions will not be accepted in place of marriage , as they do not allow the same legal rights as marriage . s2 : councils and legislatures may vote in favor of gay marriage , but it has yet to be the majority vote of the people . gay marriage should be played in a positive light by its supporters , because the current public perception of gay men is that they are promiscuous and lead a `` gay lifestyle '' that is offensive . anti-gay marriage supporters will support civil unions in lieu of gay marriage , and homosexuals should be satisfied with that .

ref_sum ->  two people are discussing gay relationships . __s1__ is in favor of these unions while s2 does not support them . __s1__ compares homosexual relationships to those of men who practice multiple marriage contending homosexuals are more committed to fidelity than those who believe in multiple marriage . s2 begs the question of how anyone can say that a man who believes in and practices multiple marriage does not love all of his wives . s2 cites a 2003 study advising at that time , 62 % of americans were not in favor of gay unions . __s1__ believes the roots are deeper than that particular poll . s2 feels he has a constitutional right to be opposed to gay marriage as well as gay people themselves .
generated -> at least 2 men in a loving , comitted relationship follow the pratice of fidelity , unlike the man who has 1 wife for each day of the week . how do s1 know that the man who has 1 wife for each day of the week does n't love his wives , or is n't committed to them . same for the wives toward their husband ? just curious ? s1 never stated that the husband or wives were not comitted to each other , s1 brought up the idea of fidelity .

Article ->  well ... so far eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue have found that barring same-sex marriage is unconstitutional . we are waiting to hear about three or four more . as for the nature of marriage , it is both a legal contract and -lrb- sometimes -rrb- a religious ceremony -lrb- sacrament in some religions -rrb- . we are stuck with the __duality__ , whether we like it or not , and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect . different religions can do what they want . they found that it violated their state __constitutions__ , right ? this has nothing to do with the us constitution . the winning arguments were based largely on state constitutional provisions that closely parallel , if not outright __mimmick__ , the federal constitution . that 's not generally true , is it ? for example , the massachusetts ruling was based on a specific provision in the mass. constitution that prohibits discrimination based on sexual preference . there 's nothing like that in the us constitution . and s2 's overall point was that we should be careful when calling something '' unconstitutional '' , in that we should be clear it we are talking state or federal constitution . many state __constitutions__ guarantee rights that are n't in the __fedral__ constitution . there 's nothing like that in the mass. . constitution either . though , it 's a __darned__ good idea ! goodrich was decided on equal protection grounds , citing the mass. document . __s1__ had have to look up the others to see the exact reasoning , but they are not likely to be far afield from the bedrock principles of equal protection and due process . gay rights is a real test of our constitutional system , and , so far , we are not passing with flying colors ... __s1__ are right , s2 __misremembered__ . it 's just __descrimination__ based on sex that 's banned .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing the issue of marriage equality . both subjects seem to be on the fence with the issue . __s1__ cites that eight of nine supreme courts have contended same sex marriage to be unconstitutional . s2 questions how gay marriage would violate someone 's constitutional rights . __s1__ advises the bulk of the arguments were based on state __constitutions__ which mirror the federal constitution . s2 uses the example of massachusetts ' allowing gay marriage under its state constitutional law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation . __s1__ contends there is no such piece to the massachusetts constitution . s2 then concedes he was incorrect about the citing and the law actually banned only discrimination based on gender and not sexual orientation .
generated -> marriage , it is both a legal contract and -lrb- sometimes -rrb- a religious ceremony -lrb- sacrament in some religions -rrb- , whether we like it or not , and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect . the winning arguments were based on state constitutional provisions that closely parallel , if not outright mimmick , the federal constitution .

Article ->  it would lead ultimately down the road to a marriage bill for __polygamists__ . that is why the current push for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage also contains a provision banning polygamous marriage as well . hmm ... . some opposition to the petition ... more left wing ideology at work . if the man after god s own heart had multiple wives , why can t i ? have heard others say that we already have polygamy in america . it s called serial polygamy because of our liberal divorce laws . so now those that are opposed to even more laws on the books and a return to old testament practices are considered left wing ? what s this world coming too ? lol king david having multiple wives was under old testament practice . jesus himself stated that divorce laws were granted by moses and allowed by god because of the __hardness__ of the people hearts . jesus said a man shall leave his father and mother and be __cleaved__ to his wife , not wives . __btw__ , its called serial __monogamy__ . if its ' right wing ' to support a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage than its ' left wing ' to oppose a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage . so is it a sin or just a practice ? s2 don t remember jesus saying polygamy was wrong . the statement __s1__ referred to does indicate that he was talking about a single wife , but s2 __wouldn__ t base a whole social convention on one word out of a whole book . anyway the jews don t believe in the new testament . would it be okay for them ? man s2 screwed that one up . s2 ll try to be a little more articulate in the future . okay was just wondering . base 's wing on what think is correct , not left or right . a few years ago it was right wing to be against the deficit , now it seems to be left wing . but that just shows what know about wings . lol the idea that it is now left wing to be against deficits is absurd . numerous democrats actually wanted to spend more than the bush administrations 12.5 % increase in federal spending . s2 was basing that on __s1__ 's previous statement in other words , anything that is opposed to one wing must be the opposite so s2 don t see how it s absurd unless __s1__ want to call __s1__ 's original statement absurd . this is obviously not the thread for this discussion but s2 will reply this time and see where it takes us . __s1__ __didn__ t state what __s1__ considered to be numerous nor did __s1__ supply anything to back up that statement . however deficits depend on both increased spending and lower revenues . bush has done both with large tax cuts and large discretionary spending increases . and even the conservatives are beginning to criticize him for being a big spending president . over the past 23 years , conservative administrations have increased the deficits and liberal administrations have decreased the deficits . so yeah it looks to me like left wing is against deficits and right wing is for deficits .
ref_sum ->  two people are debating the topic of gay marriage rights . __s1__ believes allowing gays to marry will open up the door to legalize other types of marriage such as polygamy . s2 holds to the theory that if king david was able to have multiple wives , why then should the common man not be able to , especially if religion is to now be the basis for all laws . __s1__ contends that practice was of the old testament and is no longer considered commonplace . s2 feels __s1__ is too left wing to entertain the thought of allowing gay marriage , but uses religion as the basis even though there are so many contradictions between the old testament and what is considered the new testament .
generated -> some opposition to the petition ... more left wing ideology at work . if the man after god s own heart had multiple wives , why can t i ? have heard others say that we already have polygamy in america that

Article ->  __s1__ think a better comparison is __sodom__ ... . these are the comments that make __s1__ a homophobic bigot , not __s1__ 's opposition to gay marriage . in s2 's mind yes ... . when s2 have bath houses in sf that have 100 men in a daisy chain performing unprotected sex on one another __s1__ would make the comparison to __sodom__ ... . that is not homophobic , that is a fact and s2 should condemn it too ... . so , __s1__ have been there to see this s2 take it or are __s1__ going on rumors and misinformation . did __s1__ read about this on the focus on family website ? sorry , s2 just do n't believe you . go to yahoo and do a search on san francisco gay bath houses if s2 do n't believe me ... . when the aids first came out they were shut down but they are flourishing again now and the occupants have gone back to unprotected sex ... . from what __s1__ have surmised s2 are gay . __s1__ am surprised s2 did not know that ... . you made a very specific claim about 100 men in a daisy chain having unprotected sex . it is clear to me that post was not based in fact , but opinion . if __s1__ do n't have the proof of the claim , __s1__ should n't make it ! that is what makes __s1__ a __homophobe__ . __s1__ make claims about gays without knowing the truth . why do s2 think they closed the bath houses down in the eighties ? this , at last check is 2005 , what they did in the 80 's has nothing to do with the topic at hand , or __s1__ 's comments . so either justify __s1__ 's comments or take them back and admit they were __uncalled__ for ... joe s2 need to read the link __s1__ cited in a post in this thread ... . gays in sf are trying to get the bath houses reopened ... . great ! what does that have to do with gay rights ? what does it have to do with the title of this thread ? how can __s1__ take what a small group of gays in california are doing and equate it to the behaviors of all gays . that is irresponsible .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ is against gay rights apparently because of the biblical story of __sodom__ , and the sexual activities __s1__ perceives to have occurred in san francisco bath houses , which __s1__ asserts the current gay community is trying to re-open . he argues that the gay community is going back to unprotected sex and that a daisy chain of 100 men perform unprotected sex on each other in the bath houses . s2 challenges the assumptions , specifically finding the daisy chain of 100 men a less than credible assertion and !!__admonishes__!! __s1__ to use facts to support his arguments , not opinions . s2 also notes that __s1__ 's apparent fascination with bath houses is not relevant to the gay rights topic under which the posts are being entered .

ref_sum ->  prior to this dialog , s2 apparently likened the gay marriage movement to the civil rights movement of the african american community . __s1__ is offended by the alleged analogy , finding a material distinction between race and sexual orientation . she suggests that to view it otherwise would be an insult to all african americans . s2 points out that two presumably prominent african american figures , !!__corretta__!! scott king and __jullian__ bond , are !!__pro-gay__!! marriage . __s1__ questions whether they do in fact support gay marriage , and s2 provides links to support his assertion . __s1__ accepts the evidence and concedes that some african americans may not be as insulted by the analogy and wonders how martin luther king felt about the issue of gay marriage .
generated -> yep , coretta scott king and jullian bond are against gay rights . s1 did say '' all african americans `` '' we are for gay marriage ? we are talking about gay marriage ``

Article ->  agreed , when the husband is part of a __hetero__ relationship . gay husband is not a legally recognized category . agreed , when the wife is part of a __hetero__ relationship . gay wife is not a legally recognized category . agreed , when the spouse is part of a __hetero__ relationship . gay spouse is not a legally recognized category . so the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem . what is the reason it 's not legally recognized ? because the couple is gay . where do __s1__ get the figure of 500,000 gay couples who want to immediately be married ? would these gay couples beat the straight couples in some kind of a race to the weddings occurring at the same time , or occurring over the course of a month or a year ? they are not legally recognized because they do n't meet the legal criteria for marriage , ie one man , one woman . a cat does n't meet the legal definition of a dog . do we change the definition of dog to appease the cat ? that 's the real question to be answered by society . actually , __s1__ pulled the number out of the air for __illustrative__ purposes only , but after reading the cbo report , __s1__ see that __s1__ was n't far off . they predicted 600,000 gay couples would want to get married it allowed . this is circular reasoning however . it 's stating that marriage simply is heterosexual , and so completely ends debate . exactly __s1__ 's point , just as a cat can never be considered a dog just because someone wants it to be . to me , and __s1__ is guessing millions of others , the term gay marriage is an __oxymoron__ . that 's not to say that we should n't consider the possibility of allowing gay unions with , possibly , equivalent rights to __hetero__ couples if we , as a society , see the benefit in doing so . for example , prior to fdr , the concept of state welfare was considered ludicrous and unconstitutional , but he was able to get enough support -lrb- and enough political muscle -rrb- to change society 's mind on the role of the federal gov ' t once he demonstrated the '' good '' that doing so had on america in its most dire time of need . people were willing to sacrifice a little freedom for security just as ben franklin had warned against . now , i 'll be the first to tell s2 that __s1__ think fdr was the biggest threat to american freedom that ever existed , but one ca n't argue his ability to change public opinion on the role of the federal gov ` t . it concerns reason , as __jaxian__ said earlier . what are the logical reasons for marriage discrimination against gays and lesbians ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ does not believe that anyone outside of a heterosexual marriage should be considered a husband , wife or a spouse because legally they are not . this person believes that the term gay marriage is an __oxymoron__ because marriage , legally , to them , is only between one man and one woman . they believe that prior to roosevelt , society did not accept the idea of state welfare as constitutional , but because people were willing to sacrifice freedom for security , they eventually caved to his ideas . s2 does not believe that marriage is simply between one man and one woman , and that the entire reason behind the debate is so that homosexual marriage can and will be legally recognized . they do not see a reason for discrimination against homosexual marriage .
generated -> s1 pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only , but after reading the cbo report , s1 see that s1 was n't far off . it 's stating that marriage simply is heterosexual , and so completely ends debate that

Article ->  __s1__ 's __apologizies__ . __s1__ read it hastily and got it completely __bassackwards__ . the cbo estimate in 's link did , indeed , say that the result would be up to ~ $ 1 billion surplus . so __s1__ also recognize that __s1__ 's argument that same-sex marriage does not benefit society is also '' __bassackwards__ '' ? finally ! some progress . remember ... this thread is supposed to be about fiscal concerns . __s1__ have conceded that it does n't have the negative financial impact that __s1__ thought it would . that was the purpose for __s1__ 's attempting to have a civil debate on what __s1__ thought the issues were . __s1__ had like to move past the fiscal concerns and onto the moral and health concerns if we can continue to do s2 with civility . gosh , s2 love a good typo ! in any case , s2 suppose a tepid concession is all we can expect . good catch . and s2 were hoping for ... ? a forthright concession . any maybe some discussion of how same-sex marriage benefits society in practical ways . instead , we are off to __s1__ 's safe ground of '' morality '' . safe , not because __s1__ are right , but because morality is relative and is subjective . __s1__ was hoping that s2 had be telling me the benefits , not vice versa . but s2 forget , __s1__ is not one of '' those '' who feels the need to impose __s1__ 's morality on everyone else . __s1__ is more than willing to let society as a whole determine its own limits . while __s1__ is a staunch defender of the constitution -lrb- as written , not as interpreted -rrb- , __s1__ is way more flexible with public determined acceptable standards of behavior . i 'll even cut __s1__ 's grass so that it is the same level as __s1__ 's neighbors .

Article ->  sorry , but people have certain natural rights -- keeping people from being religious infringes on that . __s1__ is not saying businesses ca n't legally do it -- they can -- __s1__ is saying __s1__ think it 's pretty unethical . it 's easy for __s1__ to sit back and say what __s1__ are saying when __s1__ dislike religion , but this is no different than an employer telling a gay employee they ca n't express themselves as being gay on the job . one is discrimination for being gay , the other is discrimination for being religious . if __s1__ are going to be for equality , then be for equality in all cases . not just picking and choosing __s1__ 's pet issues . once again __jyoshu__ ; s2 manage a fast food __resturant__ . do __s1__ agree that s2 do not have to serve boy scouts and evangelical __christains__ ? s2 's moral beliefs are against them s2 should have the right to turn away their business . after all they go against s2 's religious beliefs so s2 can refuse to serve , or even hire them . right ? if s2 use __s1__ 's logic s2 should __beable__ to do whatever s2 want and use s2 's religious beliefs as an excuse . mistaken notion ? she said clearly '' __s1__ have worked on plenty of legislation ... we enact the will of the people '' it sounds to me like she 's a legislator . that 's certainly the way it comes across -- how could s2 possibly take that any other way ? a better analogy would be if s2 were trying to force a jewish employee , whom s2 knew was jewish , to work on his sabbath rather than being willing to work with him about that . or to suddenly tell him he has to eat a pork sandwich or something . and remember , this is a different issue than __benignly__ serving food . we are talking about a major religious issue here -- gay marriage , to religious people , is like asking them to approve most any bad thing in society s2 can think of . s2 have to take the seriousness of the religious view into account here somewhat . why ? it is not s2 's problem they have evil religious values . do they work for the state or god ? does god pay their paychecks or do the taxpayers ? they just have to sign a civil contract . so what if that person is the only person able to do marriage contracts in the area . how does the state ensure that gay people can __exersize__ their right to marriage if the only person able to perform the marriage is exempted from __perfoming__ the marriage based upon religious beliefs ? __s1__ just think s2 are viewing this the wrong way -- making it more complicated than it is . it is simply a provision that allows a person to let someone else conduct the civil ceremony if their religious beliefs do n't allow them to do it . the same idea that would allow a jewish person to pass on eating pork if it were suddenly expected for him or her to do it when it was n't before . that 's all this is -- let 's not make mountains out of __molehills__ ... yet what if there is no one else in the community ? how is the government going to ensure gay people are able to __exersize__ their rights ? well , then __s1__ guess they need to ensure someone is there that will do it as well . gee , that darn religious freedom -- messing everything up , huh ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing a seemingly pending law that would permit marriage officials to decline to conduct gay marriages if they are opposed to them on religious principals . __s1__ finds it acceptable , while s2 complains about it . __s1__ proposes that it is easy for s2 to be unsympathetic because s2 dislikes religion . __s1__ acknowledges that he considers such religious objections to be evil . he suggests that because the individual licensed to perform a marriage is paid or licensed by the state , the individual should reflect the will and choices of the state and therefore perform gay marriages despite his or her personal religious objection to them . s2 suspects that the law may result in an effective denial of gay marriage .
generated -> s1 is not saying businesses ca n't legally do it to sit back and say what s1 are saying when s1 dislike religion , but this is no different than an employer telling a gay employee they ca n't legally do it . if s1 are going to be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality in all cases that

Article ->  __s1__ wish . but however much __s1__ disagree with sullivan on many political issues , he 's right about that . the world did change when the mass. legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights . it may be a big change in a small state , but it is a recognition that the winds of change are blowing against homophobic bigotry . __s1__ are just going to have to get over it . the world just is n't as anti-gay as it used to be . and that means that __s1__ are going to have to accept equal rights eventually , as gay marriage . presumably __s1__ will hope than in a few years , bigots in massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality . __s1__ think you 'll be out of luck . __s1__ wish that s2 wish . do __s1__ just like to argue for the sake of being argumentative ? __s1__ have picked out the one single thing s2 said there that __s1__ could disagree with and are making an issue of it , not even willing to agree on anything else s2 said . but fine , go ahead and think this is some __world-changing__ event if it makes __s1__ feel better . well , clearly __s1__ did n't even read s2 's post . -lrb- shrug -rrb- s2 have often posted here that s2 oppose gay marriage . that means s2 oppose equal rights for gays . if s2 have changed s2 's mind , and hope that massachusetts does n't overturn gay marriage , s2 would have said so . since s2 did n't , s2 do n't . no , __s1__ said __s1__ s2 '' will hope than in a few years , bigots in massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality '' . s2 had said , very plainly , that s2 think such legislation is an __over-intrusion__ by the government . clearly __s1__ did n't read s2 's post . are s2 claiming now s2 are in favour of legal marriage for gays in massachusetts now the legislature has voted for it ? because if so , that would be a change . s2 is saying that s2 would not want an amendment put in place banning it , because that would be an __over-intrusion__ into peoples ' lives by the government . so naturally , s2 would n't want such an amendment voted into creation , either , and that 's why s2 took issue with __s1__ 's claim that s2 would . that 's been s2 's position here for as long as s2 remember . and it 's a true conservative position -lrb- as opposed to __neocon__ -rrb- , __btw__ . are s2 saying that s2 are not in favour of a government ban on gay marriage ? s2 oppose doma laws ? does that mean s2 are now , contrary to s2 's previous posts , in favour of legal recognition of gay marriage ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing a legislative action associated with a massachusetts court ruling which is favorable to gay rights . __s1__ is enthusiastic about the matter and sees it as a step in the right direction against bigotry , and a recognition that the world is not as anti-gay as it used to be , which s2 is advised to acknowledge and accept . __s1__ also accuses s2 of being inconsistent in having been on the record on the website opposing gay marriage -lrb- and !!__therefor__!! according to __s1__ being opposed to equal rights for gays -rrb- , but now also taking a position that the state should not intervene to ban gay marriage . s2 defends that position and argues it is based on conservative principles against intrusions into individual lives .

Article ->  certainly not yours . s2 should know that __s1__ am for no marriage in government . it should be left to a religious institution where it will actually mean something . the states should then go back to doing something that actually makes sense and does n't reward people like britney spears for being white trash . that is all well and good , but it is not the religious ceremony and sanction that gays are looking for . they already have that ; there are churches that perform same-sex marriages . it is the civil benefits that are at issue . are __s1__ saying __s1__ would be in favor of __foregoing__ all the legal rights and benefits __s1__ are afforded by marriage ? for example * assumption of spouse s pension * automatic inheritance * automatic housing lease transfer * bereavement leave * burial determination * child custody * crime victim s recovery benefits * divorce protections * domestic violence protection * exemption from property tax on partner s death * immunity from testifying against spouse * insurance breaks * joint adoption and foster care * joint bankruptcy * joint parenting -lrb- insurance coverage , school records -rrb- * medical decisions on behalf of partner * certain property rights * reduced rate memberships * sick leave to care for partner * visitation of partner s children * visitation of partner in hospital or prison * wrongful death -lrb- loss of consort -rrb- benefits what do s2 say ? yeah __s1__ know . __s1__ is saying that there should be a better system . for example , if had a best friend who are roommates with ... both __hetero__ for the sake of argument ... and never wish to get married then could they get some of the benefits described ? __s1__ 's uncle actually was single until he died but he had a female friend who he was best friends with ... why could n't they get some kind of benefits if they so choose ? hospital __vistiation__ rights and things of that nature are obviously the most important in this kinda situation . it just seems the single folks are the ones getting screwed over in the marriage deal but gay folks are not ? to the single folks , s2 say get married . ok , lets use that logic ... . to the gay folks __s1__ say marry a woman . bet s2 are n't happy with that if want the benefits of marriage , get married . but ought to be able to marry a person of 's choice . 's suggestion would be to marry someone s2 do n't want to me married to , that is a different thing . it is not using '' that logic '' . s2 thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you . is n't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities ? s2 am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly . s2 happen to think that 's a bad idea . people get married for many reasons , some of which s2 would feel are not good reasons , but s2 would not make it illegal to do so . s2 am talking about the right to marry a person of 's choosing .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 discuss the civil benefits of marriage and how they could or could not be extended to single people and gay people . __s1__ is initially against government being involved in the equation , but after s2 describes many of the legal rights and benefits associated with marriage , such as automatic inheritance and hospital visitation rights , __s1__ is then able to relate to the issues by considering the case of his life-long bachelor uncle , suggesting that it is single people who are discriminated against by being excluded from the marriage benefits . s2 suggests that if a single person desires the benefits of marriage , they should marry , but that they should be able to marry a person of either gender as they see fit .
generated -> s2 should know that s1 am for no marriage in government . the states should then go back to doing something that actually makes sense and does n't reward people like britney spears for being white trash . it is the civil benefits that are at issue .

ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that his opposition to gay marriage is based on the belief that it will hurt more people than it helps , not on bigotry . he suggests that it would hurt people with a traditional view of marriage as between a man and a woman , and that the benefits of marriage can be gained by homosexuals without redefining marriage . s2 argues that gay marriage does not hurt anyone , straight or gay , and offending proponents of traditional marriage is not a valid argument against it . he believes that preventing gay marriage is simply faith based hate . he claims that having separate rules for straight and gay marriage creates the possibility of those rules being different for the two groups , allowing the gay minority to be disenfranchised .

Article ->  it seems to me that the point there is that it is not a bigot ... er , spade merely because __s1__ call it a spade . __imo__ , if someone has to resort to name-calling , it tends to only indicate they are having to resort to something besides sound arguments . oh my . perhaps we should say it 's an anti-gay bias , or a person with an __anit-gay__ bias ? are the terms __acceptance-challenged__ , __inclusion-challenged__ , anti-discrimination challenged , appealing to you ? e __mutz__ or his '' joe '' , assumed those protesting against gay discrimination are nuts or trying to hijack heritage , but wo n't say why . if it walks like a duck and __quacks__ like a duck , chances are ... or maybe he 's simply arguing a different point than you . __imo__ it 's just simply arrogant of s2 to automatically write off disagreement as '' bigotry '' . your view is that this is about '' acceptance '' ; but that does n't mean that 's the real issue . e __mutz__ is right in saying that disagreement is not the same as bigotry . what is the basis for the disagreement or the different point of view if it is not a lack of acceptance of homosexuality or its visible and open displays and representations ? but the problem is that s2 insist on always __mischaracterizing__ that as bigotry . it 's a very ugly word , and __s1__ suspect that 's the reason s2 use it -lrb- for its effect -rrb- and why s2 do n't entertain the idea that bigotry may not always be what 's behind it . s2 say it is , and s2 explain why . replace the word '' gay '' with another minority , and tell me it is not . it 's an ugly thing . s2 have explained why s2 believe that 's what 's behind it . if __s1__ believe do n't believe that , why do n't __s1__ tell me what is behind it ? __s1__ think it all goes back to one 's motivations . what __s1__ do n't think s2 and some others understand is that people often do n't take that stand on the basis of not liking gay people . they do it because of the way they view marriage . if any other minority came along wanting marriage to be changed from one man and one woman , __s1__ suspect they had get the same response . we were n't just discussing marriage specifically . somehow whenever gays are involved , a group of people take a stand of being opposed , because of the way they view one thing or another in society , as being __straight-only__ , or excluding gays . yes , from the anti-gay crowd , sorry those who do n't wish to include gays . however , no other identified minority would want that , because only one minority identifies as gay . but it 's not always about __not-including-gays__ . that 's not the basis in many cases . -lrb- hey , that rhymes ! -rrb- it 's about the way they view marriage ! they had be that way toward any group wanting to change marriage to fit themselves if it changed marriage from the traditional view . __s1__ assure s2 if there was a movement afoot in this country by __polygamists__ to change marriage to include them , there would be a similar reaction toward that . it 's not that s2 are gay . it 's that s2 want to redefine marriage . ah , there 's no use . __s1__ have tried to get s2 to see this before .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that it is inappropriate to label disagreement as bigotry , and that while someone might think an argument is bigoted , it may be motivated by something other than bigotry . he argues that many people 's opinions are based on their view of marriage , not their dislike of homosexuals , and that they would be against any group wanting to alter the traditional view of marriage . s2 claims that opponents of gay rights are discriminatory and bigoted . he suggests that if you replaced gays with another minority , then the arguments against them would appear negative -lrb- e. g. , trying to exclude any other minority from getting married would not be acceptable -rrb- . he believes that opponents of gay marriage are not protecting traditional marriage , but are discriminating against homosexuals .

ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that aids was initially spread in the us primarily be homosexuals and that no one argues with this fact . he believes that the resources spent fighting the disease could have been better spent on other diseases such as cancer if the homosexual minority had not spread aids to the heterosexual majority with their promiscuous sexual activity . he !!__clarifies__!! that now that aids does exist , he does not advocate ignoring aids research . s2 agrees that aids was initially contracted and spread by homosexuals , but claims that its early spread was due to blood transfusions rather than sexual contact . he suggests that __s1__ believes that homosexuals are less important than !!__heterosexuals__!! based on his comment that other diseases are more important to cure than aids .

Article ->  yet s2 still will not answer the question . how does equal marriage hurt her or any heterosexual ? if she has her way __s1__ am the one that is hurt . __s1__ 's way of equal marriage __s1__ am not hurt nor is she . yes s2 did , in this post . s2 __summarize__ so what if a proposed law '' hurts '' you ? there are all kinds of laws that '' hurt '' all kinds of people . but is glad to see that s2 abandoned s2 's silly argument that it would be a violation of the first amendment to enact her religious belief about marriage , but not a violation of the first amendment to enact your religious belief about marriage . now , if s2 could only justify why only laws which do not cause '' harm '' to others are allowed to be enacted . frankly am astounded by s2 's affinity for the '' harm principle '' when s2 say things like '' do n't know about the '' culture war '' but am at war with evangelical anti gay christianity . will do whatever it takes to knock then down . '' because __s1__ am only concerned with rights of gay people . gay people are __s1__ 's first concern . this evil woman should come out and __sayshe__ is anti gay . she should come out and say she does n't want gay people to get married . she should admit that she wants gay people to remain second class citizens . why does n't she own up to her discrimination ? she wants to protect her heterosexual __privledge__ . for the record __s1__ own that statement and stand behind it . __s1__ will talk people out of attending these bible churches . __s1__ will do what __s1__ can to legally disrupt any __rundrasining__ activities they have going . __s1__ will protest their wedding ceremonies . __s1__ will protest their church services . as far as __s1__ am concerned , once they crossed over the line and started pushing for and getting laws enacted that hurt me , __s1__ 's family , __ands__ __s1__ 's people , they have no place in society . and __s1__ have yet to show why this is not a legitimate viewpoint , nor a legitimate way to legislate this issue . it 's obvious that all __s1__ care about is gay people . however , __s1__ have not shown why anti-gay -lrb- as __s1__ call them -rrb- people should not be able to legislate their view . all __s1__ have said is that __s1__ do n't like their view . big deal , they do n't like __s1__ 's view either . thus , in a democracy like ours , the majority of people decide issues like this . besides that , s2 think coming out in support of a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage qualifies as '' com -lsb- ing -rsb- out and say -lsb- ing -rsb- that she does n't want gay people to get married . '' this is fine . but also understand that it is legitimate for people who believe like ms. __musgrave__ to do the same , including to use the democratic process to have her view enacted in law . if __s1__ are free to do it , then she is as well . should the majority have the right to __enslave__ their fellow citizens ? should the majority have the right to lock people up in concentration camps ? a majority of the people in the us once thought it was a good idea . oh __s1__ want the evil woman to say it . __s1__ want her __viciousness__ and ugliness out in the open . if she is anti gay then she needs to own up to her bigotry repent america believes in protesting and disrupting gay gatherings . why if they can do this __s1__ can do the same . the majority did have the legal right -lrb- unfortunately -rrb- to __enslave__ their fellow citizens until the 13 th amendment took that option off the table . incidentally , it took a majority of people to take slavery off of the table . in the united states , the majority wins -lrb- for good or for ill -rrb- . s2 hope __s1__ are not trying to make a comparison between the denial of marriage to gays -lrb- and to 10 year olds , and to those who are currently married yet want another husband / wife , and to those who wish to marry their father , etc. -rrb- on the one hand , and slavery and / or concentration camps on the other . ok , and what would that accomplish ? yeah , that 's exactly what s2 said .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are talking about how democracy is based on majority rule and whether or not its fair . __s1__ believes it is completely unfair that gay marriage be dismissed or disliked and s2 argues that no matter what __s1__ believes is right or wrong , the majority of people control what is normal in our society . that if __s1__ is only towards the rights of gay people it is completely understandable for this lady to be in belief that marriage as is is fine . s2 believes that __s1__ 's argument is not a legitimate viewpoint because __s1__ has no justification that this lady hates gays . __s1__ believes that because this lady is not in favor of gay marriage , the lady is anti-gay . __s1__ is taking an aggressive approach by saying they will talk to bible churches and disrupt them because she feels like she has no place in society . __s1__ thinks that the majority of people is !!__enslaving__!! their people by not allowing gay rights , but s2 argues that it happens that way and it changes over time .

Article ->  agreed she is ignoring __s1__ 's religious freedom and trying to institute her religion into law . the law that will bar __s1__ 's family from legal protections . it wo n't protect her marriage but will bar me and __s1__ 's people from from being full citizens . she is n't protecting marriage but __perserving__ her heterosexual __privledge__ . how on earth is she impeding on __s1__ religious freedom ? she is n't trying to take away __s1__ 's right to any religious ceremony . with such a wide-open standard of what constitutes religious freedom that __s1__ seem to have , any legislation could be construed as imposing on religious freedom . because it is her religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman . __s1__ 's religious belief is that marriage is between two people that love each other regardless of sex . she is tying to place her religious __belif__ into law over mine . who gets hurt here ? if __s1__ 's religious belief is put into law she can still marry the person of her choice . if her religious belief gets put into law she can still marry the person of her choice but __s1__ do not get to . so __s1__ and __s1__ 's people are hurt by __codifing__ her religious belief into law . she is trying to keep gay people out of marriage and thus preserve her heterosexual __privledge__ . but by that definition , either one could be viewed as impeding on religious freedom , including __s1__ 's view impeding on hers ! we do n't define imposing on religious freedom on the basis of having different ideals . it does n't effect __s1__ 's religion or religious freedom if __s1__ do n't get benefits under gay marriages . __s1__ can argue in other ways , on other basis , but the idea that not giving gays marriage benefits is imposing on religious freedom is an empty '' argument '' . but s2 have not shown how she would be harmed by equal marriage ? __s1__ have shown that her definition infringes upon __s1__ 's religious freedom . if gay marriage becomes a reality then in no way does it infringe upon her in any way . would s2 care to explain how gay marriage infringes upon her in any way ? it is her heterosexual __privledge__ and her __sence__ of entitlement that she is protecting not marriage . __s1__ may -lrb- or may not -rrb- can show harm in another sense , but __s1__ certainly have not shown how __s1__ 's religious rights are taken away or harmed , to begin with . that 's the point . __s1__ certainly have not shown how her definition infringes upon __s1__ 's religious freedom -- __s1__ are still free to be just as religious in practice and belief as ever if __musgrave__ 's views became law . __s1__ are trying to use a religious freedom argument here and it just does n't fit . yes __s1__ have . have n't s2 been __poaying__ attention ? -rsb- because it is her religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman . __s1__ 's religious belief is that marriage is between two people that love each other regardless of sex . she is tying to place her religious __belif__ into law over mine . who gets hurt here ? if __s1__ 's religious belief is put into law she can still marry the person of her choice . if her religious belief gets put into law she can still marry the person of her choice but __s1__ do not get to . so __s1__ and __s1__ 's people are hurt by __codifing__ her religious belief into law . she is trying to keep gay people out of marriage and thus preserve her heterosexual __privledge__ . ok ! s2 's religious belief says that it 's important to smoke in public __non-smoking__ areas . s2 's religious belief says that it 's important to drive cars as fast as one can on city streets . s2 's religious belief says that the death penalty should never be enforced . gee , this it fun , using religion as an excuse and means to an end to fight legislation ! too bad for __s1__ it does n't work that way . what __s1__ do n't get is that , by __s1__ 's standard , either would be placing one religion over another . the same justification could be made against __s1__ 's view because __s1__ 's view goes against my religious belief . and then if __s1__ say '' but __s1__ 's view causes harm and mine does n't '' then it 's no longer a religious issue so the point is moot to begin with . you missed the point here she is trying to turn her religious belief into law that bars me from from getting married . how is she hurt if it is __s1__ 's religious belief of equal marriage is turned into law ? __s1__ have no idea whether or not she is truly trying to turn her religious belief into law . she may just happen to believe that way religiously , but be pushing for the law because she thinks that 's best for __socety__ . __iow__ , __s1__ have no idea if religion is her real motivation for the law . there 's no way to know or to police someone 's real motivations . __s1__ am part of society and her belief is not in __s1__ 's best __intrest__ . how does __s1__ 's being able to marry a man hurt her in any way ?
ref_sum ->  this is about gay marriage . __s1__ seems to believe that someone is making religion into law by saying marriage should be between a heterosexual couple . s2 is arguing that __s1__ 's point is not very valid because __s1__ is not understanding that they are not using the persons perspective . __s1__ believes that that person is trying to hurt them , while s2 is saying that the person may not necessarily be that way and that the person may be arguing for what they believe to be greater for society , based on their own perspective . __s1__ 's religious view of marriage is based on two people 's love for each other , while the other person believes its between a man and woman . s2 says __s1__ 's argument is empty and that __s1__ is not showing how the other person is being hurt by gay marriage . s2 thinks __s1__ is not understanding the overall perspectives and just focusing on their own needs . __s1__ states that the person 's religion put into law affects peoples ability to marry if they are gay , but that __s1__ 's religion on marriage put into law would not affect marriage for anyone .

Article ->  __lesz__ , __s1__ 's marriage means a great many things to me , none of which have anything to do with our governments . __s1__ 's question to s2 is what do __s1__ think marriage should mean to our governments ? well , marriage is an ancient human institution , based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans , and is one of the foundations of social stability . why would it surprise anyone that government might wish to support it ? what really surprises me is to find how many alleged christians now find it __expedient__ to demand government '' get out of marriage '' , simply because gay people want to get in it . bunch of hypocrites -- they never complained about government regulating marriage before this . now , while s2 agree it is n't absolutely essential for government to be involved in the regulation and support of marriage , it is nevertheless a convenience that few people would really want to throw away . -lrb- mr. __writela__ has summed it up eloquently so s2 need n't elaborate . -rrb- alas , many are just too mean-spirited to share marriage with those pesky __homos__ , so they have jumped on the __get-out-of-marriage__ bandwagon -- which is n't going to go anywhere -- as camouflage for their real feelings . that government would wish to be involved in any aspect of our lives , would not surprise me . that is what governments tend to do . consider the '' healthy marriage initiative '' . this is our government and as citizens , we would be well advised to exercise vigilance to prevent our government from __intruding__ into areas where there is no necessity . just because a few mean-spirited hypocrites may advocate that the government get out of marriage for the wrong reasons does not mean that the idea is all bad . never happen ? enlist the 100 single people who have the biggest stake in this issue and chip away at the exclusive benefits . start with an easy one like hospital visitation and work up to the tough ones like social security to spouses why ? why is it in the interests of society to prevent government involvement in marriage ? that 's what __s1__ have n't explained . __mrwritela__ pointed out the reasons that government involvement is pretty much unavoidable , if only because government is the source of law . it seems to me __s1__ advocate the replacement of marriage with a plethora of minor and specific legal contracts that would only benefit the lawyers writing them . it 's the wood and the trees . if specific laws are trees , then marriage is the forest that protects our relationships from such gales that xxxx . is there any specific advantage to looking to individual trees and ignoring the wood ? __lesz__ __s1__ ask why and s2 ask why not . why should government get out of the marriage business 1 . it is not needed 2 . the current marriage benefits are terribly unfair to single people that are forced to pay for them . __s1__ 's __eloquence__ notwithstanding , have found it useful to look very closely at the trees when solving problems . would suggest that one can not understand the wood unless one knows something about trees . also , have often found it useful to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller parts and solving the easiest parts first . why is government support of marriage unfair to single people ? single people do not have the same issues as married people . having been married and single myself , s2 do have some insight here . and why would rather married people go to lawyers for multiple legal contracts to cover all the hundreds of rights and mutual obligations currently conferred by marriage ? are a lawyer in need of clients ? __;-rrb-__ s2 's own experience of woods and trees is that there is no value in looking at them in only one way . one needs to consider them as trees and woods . __s1__ have also been single and married . experience but not much insight . __s1__ would be interested to hear s2 's views about this difference in issues and how these issues are helped by government involvement . __lesz__ , __s1__ am an engineer , not a lawyer . well , single people live by themselves , not as a family . by definition , they do not have a significant relationship -- and no , s2 do n't count boyfriends or girlfriends here , s2 am referring to committed couples who live together as a family unit . there are many legal issues such as inheritance , pension and social security rights , adoption and child custody , home ownership , etc. , which would need separate legal contracts without the umbrella of marriage . -lrb- and of course , even then such contracts would only be enforceable by government . -rrb- s2 myself had tremendous difficulties sorting out property issues with s2 's partner 's family after he died . it all but __bankrupted__ me , and there would n't have been any issue at all had it been legal for us to get married . we did have some legal contracts pertaining to the house , and wills , but alas they were n't good enough to get his family off s2 's back , because our legal relationship was trumped by his familial one . s2 am not saying it could n't be done piecemeal , tailor-made to suit each individual couple , but would n't that be excessively inconvenient -- for everyone but the lawyers ? whereas at __prresent__ , when __s1__ get married for a $ 25 license , hey presto , __s1__ get those protections and the lawyers have to defer their caribbean cruise .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are debating the topic of what marriage should mean to our government . __s1__ believes it is not a bad idea because they think it is not necessary for the government to be involved in most aspects of our lives , while s2 is questioning why it 's necessary to try and remove government involvement when it is unavoidable . __s1__ brings up that because several people are against the government due to gay marriage and not because it 's just marriage altogether , it does n't mean it 's not a bad idea to remove government intervention . __s1__ mentions the `` healthy marriage initiative '' and how it is n't necessary . s2 says that there is too much legal work and documents behind marriage in the government , such as inheritance , pension and social rights , etc. . , and that it would be a lot more work if the government did n't intervene , also stating that removing marriage from government will only benefit lawyers . both __s1__ and s2 have had experience with marriage , s2 states that marriage benefits are good because of government intervention .
generated -> marriage '' an ancient human institution , based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans , and is one of the foundations of social stability that alas , many are just too mean-spirited to share marriage with those pesky homos , so they have jumped on the get-out-of-marriage bandwagon . why is it in the interests of society to prevent government involvement in marriage ? that

'' __s1__ have already said __s1__ know it 's inconsistent , but that __s1__ do n't care . it 's not a pet issue for me . it is for you . yet s2 are far more concerned , it seems , about the inconsistency on __s1__ 's part than on biden 's part . yet it 's biden who 's s2 's candidate . stop the dishonesty of pretending __s1__ have n't already addressed that . actually , s2 did n't think __s1__ had recognized what __s1__ had admitted . next sentence __s1__ talked about biden ... '' more concerned '' ? s2 am arguing against the general position . it does n't matter who holds it . one of the points with biden , as explained in multiple points before , is how the perception of holding his feet to the fire could impact others ... if s2 could have a private one-on-one with biden , or if he logged on anonymously to this __web-site__ , s2 would discuss it with him just the same . quite frankly , the '' he 's our candidate '' thing is one of the things that takes precedent . see , we do n't approach these things as '' single issue '' type guys . we weigh the '' gay marriage opinion '' up against the impact of pushing him hard on it a few weeks away from election day , and balance the responding approach accordingly . s2 hear somewhere that '' single issue '' guys can be frowned upon . that ai n't us ...
ref_sum ->  it seems like they are discussing the inconsistency of each other 's arguments . __s1__ is getting annoyed and seems to just be arguing because they are `` venting '' while s2 is saying that the inconsistency is present and making all arguments invalid without proof . both __s1__ and s2 are for gay rights , s2 is stating that __s1__ is n't being consistent and `` admits '' to being inconsistent , while __s1__ is saying they do n't care about the inconsistency because of the point they are trying to get across . they bring up biden and abortion in ways that dont exactly fit the discussion , but just to show the inconsistency in each others opinions . s2 is saying they would handle this same situation with biden the exact same way because s2 is simply talking about perspective . __s1__ believes s2 is stating that __s1__ believes in gay marriage but not gay rights , which seems contradictory to __s1__ 's point . this argument does not have a set topic .
generated -> again , s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't mean there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency .

Article ->  because it 's all quite clear . decades of effort from the religious right , conservative republicans , and their like have made gay rights a poisoned topic . it 's a tragedy , but saying the right thing on this issue will cost s2 more votes than it will gain you , everyone knows it , and no one is going to do it . it 's politics 101 . the democrats , as a whole , want to do the right thing , but they know that if they say so too loudly they wo n't be in a position to do anything . they are forced to moderate their public stances so that they can get into positions where they can actually take action . this is of course a __generalization__ , but if s2 are talking about a political party as a whole that 's unavoidable . so , __s1__ are basically saying that biden was lying through his teeth when he said he does n't support gay marriage ? it was all just a lie to keep from losing votes ? interesting . possibly , __s1__ could n't say . certainly as a democrat he gets more benefit of the doubt than __s1__ would give a republican when it comes to gay rights , but __s1__ have n't __plumbed__ his record enough to say for sure . and let 's be honest here , s2 do not find the idea that a politician might be lying interesting . what s2 had prefer is that the candidates be honest about their views , whether it 's popular or unpopular . but even knowing we are talking about political candidates -lrb- who may lie to get votes -rrb- , when a candidate says something is his or her view , s2 think we have to take them at what they say when they answer a question like that so directly and emphatically . otherwise , there 's little point in asking questions to begin with other than maybe watching the reaction of body language and how they would respond under pressure , and so forth . political discourse has to operate to where when a candidate gives a given view as his or her view , they are taken at their word that is their view . '' no '' ca n't mean '' yes '' and so forth . no , that 's too __niave__ an approach . we know politicians are going to tell some lies , __s1__ trust that 's a given . we , as political consumers , ca n't simply take politicians at their word . if we want to make informed decisions about candidates we need to develop the skills to make useful judgement calls about what they are saying . we need to figure out how often they lie , what they lie about , how big their lies are . obviously we should n't need to do this , it would be great if we could actually take our politicians at their word . bad the sad reality is that we ca n't , not at this stage anyway . in this particular case , if biden says he does n't support gay marriage __s1__ is just as likely to think it 's because he knows that open support could cost him the white house as any other reason . it 's sad that such double speak is needed , __s1__ had love it if enough courageous politicians stood forth and ended the political need for lies , but until that wonderful day __s1__ is not going to be naive and take everything they say at their word , nor am __s1__ going to jump up and down and point fingers at every __falsehood__ . i 'll try to judge the politicians by their actions , and their lies by their magnitude , scope , and quantity . s2 think __s1__ are misunderstanding me -- s2 do n't mean s2 think we should assume they are going to always tell the truth -- s2 mean we should put the expectation on them to be honest . __iow__ , honesty is what we should demand . if we are n't even going to do that , there 's no point in ever asking a political candidate a direct question . knowing they are going to lie is n't the same as having the expectation on them to be honest . s2 really do n't think it 's too much to ask our candidates to say what their views are . __s1__ just said yourself '' we need to figure out how often they lie , what they lie about , how big their lies are '' so , obviously , __s1__ believe it 's not really good that they are lying . there would be little point in asking them questions if we are n't going to hold to them to some level of expectation that they are going to say what they mean . sure , they lie , but if the words of politicians mean nothing , there 's little point in even having political discourse . political cynicism is no excuse to not put expectations on our candidates to be honest with the american people .
ref_sum ->  this is about politics and whether or not the lie in order to get more votes . __s1__ believes politicians sometimes may lie as long as its what is the majority , while s2 is saying that s2 is more concerned with the honesty of the candidates rather than whether they are lying or not . s2 says we should expect them to be honest , because that is what we should want from politicians . __s1__ argues that politicians seem to lie in order to get the position they want or sway people to become popular , while s2 thinks that we should rely on them to make the right decision . __s1__ seems to think that s2 is making an argument for their belief , but s2 is just trying to be honest and show the other perspective . they argue about politicians lying through discussing when politicians are asked questions and how they answer them . s2 finishes by telling __s1__ we should not label politicians and expect them to do and say the right , honest thing .
generated -> conservative republicans say the right thing on this issue will cost s2 more votes than it will gain you , everyone knows it , and no one is going to do it . it 's politics 101 , but if s2 are talking about a political party as a whole that 's unavoidable . so , s1 are basically saying that biden was lying through his teeth when he said he does n't support gay marriage ?

Article ->  we do n't just benefit from what is often considered the common , nuclear family . we benefit from families with adopted children , step children , families with no children at all . no it does not . prove it will come up , and also prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . marriage is that now . s2 are right , it has nothing to do with the bible . it has everything to do with the slippery slope logical __fallacy__ , which we have discussed in the forum ad __nauseum__ . it only shows that those opposed do not have an argument . s2 know the prospect of incest and polygamy is much less socially acceptable than gay marriage , so s2 try to erroneously tie polygamy and incest to gay marriage in people 's mind to strike fear in them , and hope their logical reasoning can be replaced by irrational fear . a married couple as the head of a home is considered a nuclear family it already has . the question of legality is what this whole issue is about . marriage is a legal __instituation__ , how could legality not come up . yes it is whoa ... hold up ... are __s1__ saying that only because gay marriage is less unacceptable that incestuous relations , that its ok to grant gay marriage but not sibling marriage ?? if the incestuous society begin to parade and protest , until society accepts them on the level that they accept gays now , what will __s1__ say then ? on what grounds should we discriminate against 2 siblings wanting to get married , particularly if they believe they truly love each other , or if they believe that they were born with that attraction ? this is classic __hypocracy__ . if 2 siblings want to love each other in their private lives , how is that any business of yours ? and what does irrational fear have to do with anything ? do __s1__ have an irrational fear of an incestuous or polygamous lifestyle ? based on what ? give me one reason why society __shouldnt__ accept an incestuous relation between two consenting adults then what may lead to incest and polygamy is the fact that marriage is a legal institution , is that what s2 are saying ? if so , these things may come up equally as a result of straight legal marriage or gay legal marriage or interracial legal marriage , or legal __inter-faith__ marriage or legal marriage with legal divorce , etc. . it does n't relate specifically to gay legal marriage at all . __s1__ was saying this is how many people attempt an argument against gay marriage , by attempting to incite fear by spouting off a parade of __horribles__ that have nothing to do with the issue of gay marriage . what if straight people are married and winged green monkeys come flying out of everyone 's derriere in the future ? what will s2 do then ? demonstrate how gay marriage specifically relates to incest and incestuous marriage and polygamy . this is the gay rights forum , not the incest forum . thats not what im saying . what may lead to incestuous marriage is if siblings or related people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . and what may lead to polygamous marriage is 3 or more people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . do __s1__ see a pattern here ? __ooooh__ . . nice way to snake out of the issue ... let me refresh __s1__ 's memory since __s1__ brought it up , what exactly does the social acceptance of any type of '' taboo '' relationship have to do with their right to be legally married ? is there a certain limit of '' __tabooness__ '' , and if __youre__ past that limit then no marriage for you ? and what fear are __s1__ talking about ? s2 is talking about people that love each other and want to tie the knot . how could that possibly strike fear in somebody ? please ... . yes , that 's true . yes , that 's true . are s2 saying love is the pattern ? well , love applies to straight marriages as well as gay marriages . love is not exclusive to gay marriages . if that 's the connection , we can just as easily say straight marriage will lead to incestuous marriage and polygamy . s2 are saying love will cause a slippery slope . it 's still __fallacious__ . the issue __s1__ brought up was why this __fallacy__ is often used , that is to create fear , because incest and polygamy are indeed considered so taboo . the issue is not the __tabooness__ of anything and everything , but how it is being used to distract from the issue of same-sex marriage , when there is n't a logical , rational argument against same-sex marriage . it 's an indication of desperation on the part of some of those who are against same-sex marriage . __s1__ have no reason to discuss the level of __acceptability__ or lack thereof of every single thing , before __s1__ accept one thing that is different from all those other things . __s1__ can deal with that one thing on all of its own merits and shortfalls , without being drawn into a false dilemma , either accept everything or else do n't accept one thing , as if those are the only two choices , __fallacy__ . gay marriage will change the definition of marriage from '' a legal union between a man and a woman '' to '' a legal union between any parties that love each other '' . if its ok for 2 people that love each other and want to tie the knot , then how could incest be a taboo ? based on what ? again with the double standard . gay marriage was considered just as much a taboo as incest or polygamy just a few years ago . being gay emerged from its taboo status through parades , promotional efforts , and , unfortunately , by spreading lies -lrb- i 'll deal with that in another thread -rrb- . however , incestuous people __didnt__ go through the process of parading their lifestyle in front of the world and practically begging for approval from society . so incest is still deeper in taboo status than homosexuality . why is it ok to deny incestuous relations the right to marry on the grounds that it is considered taboo , but ok to approve gay marriage on the same grounds ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are debating whether making gay marriage legal will open opportunities for other `` taboos '' in our society . __s1__ believes that in opening this opportunity for gay marriage , the definition of marriage will change and it will allow other issues like incest and polygamy to become legal . s2 accuses __s1__ of __hypocracy__ . in a sense , they believe gay marriage will have a sort of domino effect for other issues . __s1__ is arguing that using these other issues to be evidence for why !!__gay-marriage__!! should n't be allowed is not a valid argument . then __s1__ goes on to say that this tactic is used to instill fear to those who do not support those other issues . __s1__ understands the other issues , but does n't see the relationship between those and that of same-sex marriage . s2 keeps arguing that it __shouldnt__ be different figuring out whether one can approve gay marriage but not incest since they believe the two to be somewhat related .
generated -> prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . marriage is that now , and prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . it has everything to do with the slippery slope logical fallacy , which we have discussed in the forum ad nauseum .

Article ->  matt , this is getting ridiculous . s2 made an assertion that republicans would send gays to concentration camps like the germans did in the holocaust . then s2 brought up a statement by paul cameron , as if paul cameron has anything to do whatsoever with republican politics or leadership . now if s2 had linked someone in the republican leadership saying those things , s2 might have something , but s2 did n't . paul cameron is a psychologist that has gone over the top at times with some of the things he 's said about gays and has paid a price for it . he 's a frequent target of the gay pride movement for __demonization__ and because he did n't tow the line with the apa 's political stances , they distanced themselves from him . __s1__ do n't agree with everything he says either , for that matter . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking ; the most s2 can say is that they are paul cameron talking . well , sure -- anything could happen . a military coup could take place and we had have martial law . a new ice age could start in the next year . an asteroid could be on its way to hit earth . but there 's a big difference between possibility and likelihood . paul cameron is the single most frequently quoted '' expert '' cited by the gop in all their attempts to limit the rights of gay people . his '' research '' has been entered in the congressional record countless times . it really is astounding that anyone would have anything to do with him . including you . what price ? without his revolting beliefs and __star-power__ , he had be flipping burgers somewhere . instead , he 's raking in a fortune speaking to the '' moral '' groups __s1__ are constantly defending . he was dismissed from the group for conducting fraudulent research . cameron talking ... gop repeating . seriously , __jyoshu__ , the man called for extermination . how can __s1__ support him or cite him or defend him at all __??????__ how can s2 not stay on point ? unless cameron is a part of the gop __leadeship__ , matt is pulling some wild point out of his hat , saying that because someone who may not even be a republican hates gays , that republicans hate gays . __s1__ might as well have said that since john lennon attacked religion , then democrats hate religion . yes , his comments are that ludicrous . this is not about paul cameron no matter how much s2 had love to change the subject , it 's about matt 's ridiculous __generalizations__ and comments . oh , and s2 need to get up with the times -- no national political party has used cameron 's information in a serious way in a long time . __s1__ is sure you 'll now be googling to try and find republican individuals out there on the internet citing cameron , but that 's not the party leadership or its platform . there is no republican in leadership that would call for the extermination of gays , and s2 know it . nor does the platform say so . so let 's put that little lie to bed right now . sorry , sir . since __s1__ did n't stay on point , s2 thought others were just as free to wander . if democratic legislators from sea to shining sea quoted lennon 's lyrics about '' imagine no religion '' at every session that talked about religious freedom , __s1__ might draw that conclusion , no ? __ooops__ . s2 thought it was about a conservative democrat in minnesota bragging about '' inside information '' from that state 's supreme court . uh ... how about the president of the united states ??? paul cameron 's research is cited in virtually every single attack on gay people in state after state after state legislature . it was presented in the '' debate '' about same-sex marriage in the u.s. __friggin__ ' senate . his name appears in the citations of virtually every legal brief filed by opponents of same-sex marriage . __http__ think he even made it into lawrence v. texas . the man is president of the family research institute . he can probably phone up ol ' __dubya__ anytime he gets the urge . and __dubya__ will put down his pretzel and pick up the phone . what should be put to bed is paul cameron and every single bogus study related to him . that supposedly reasonable people would even mention his name is surprising . ok , __s1__ now realize something __s1__ did n't earlier -- that __http__ are obviously a dnc __shill__ . no one else would make such a ridiculous __generalization__ . __http__ really do think that 's all conservatives talk about , huh ? __s1__ hate to bust __http__ 's bubble , but it 's not . __s1__ know __http__ 's martyr complex is important to you , but it 's just not accurate . -lrb- shrug -rrb- what are __s1__ talking about ? s2 said __s1__ had probably be right to assume that some people were __anti-religion__ if they consistently talked about what a wonderful world it would be without it ? over and over . at every opportunity . and never had a single nice word to say about it . ever . __s1__ really are laughable when __s1__ try to defend the gop when one of their admittedly most effective propaganda campaigns is to rally the '' __family-values__ '' crowd against gay rights . it 's openly admitted by them . they are proud of their tactics . very odd ...
ref_sum ->  this seems to be an argument about gay rights and !!__generalizing__!! the political beliefs of people . according to __s1__ , s2 talks about paul cameron and makes it seem as if he is the voice of the republicans . __s1__ argues that it is not the case and one person who sides with a specific party does n't represent the party . __s1__ uses john lennon as an example of this not being a proper way to !!__generalize__!! political views of parties , in his case the democratic party . __s1__ accuses s2 of making an assertion including the republicans creating another holocaust , because of the !!__generalization__!! that s2 made . s2 believes that paul cameron 's views are cited and used in many cases against gay rights because most people do share the same views , which __s1__ thinks otherwise . s2 says that most attacks on gay rights have cited paul cameron , even within the us senate , showing that he has a strong opinion in the republican party , or at least it seems so .
generated -> is a psychologist that has gone over the top at times with some of the things he 's said about gays and has paid a price for that matter . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking ; the most s2 can say is that they are paul cameron talking . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking ; the most s2 can say is that they are paul cameron talking . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking .

Article ->  sorry , but people have certain natural rights -- keeping people from being religious infringes on that . __s1__ is not saying businesses ca n't legally do it -- they can -- __s1__ is saying __s1__ think it 's pretty unethical . it 's easy for __s1__ to sit back and say what __s1__ are saying when __s1__ dislike religion , but this is no different than an employer telling a gay employee they ca n't express themselves as being gay on the job . one is discrimination for being gay , the other is discrimination for being religious . if __s1__ are going to be for equality , then be for equality in all cases . not just picking and choosing __s1__ 's pet issues . once again __jyoshu__ ; s2 manage a fast food __resturant__ . do __s1__ agree that s2 do not have to serve boy scouts and evangelical __christains__ ? s2 's moral beliefs are against them s2 should have the right to turn away their business . after all they go against s2 's religious beliefs so s2 can refuse to serve , or even hire them . right ? if s2 use __s1__ 's logic s2 should __beable__ to do whatever s2 want and use s2 's religious beliefs as an excuse . mistaken notion ? she said clearly '' __s1__ have worked on plenty of legislation ... we enact the will of the people '' it sounds to me like she 's a legislator . that 's certainly the way it comes across -- how could s2 possibly take that any other way ? a better analogy would be if s2 were trying to force a jewish employee , whom s2 knew was jewish , to work on his sabbath rather than being willing to work with him about that . or to suddenly tell him he has to eat a pork sandwich or something . and remember , this is a different issue than __benignly__ serving food . we are talking about a major religious issue here -- gay marriage , to religious people , is like asking them to approve most any bad thing in society s2 can think of . s2 have to take the seriousness of the religious view into account here somewhat . why ? it is not s2 's problem they have evil religious values . do they work for the state or god ? does god pay their paychecks or do the taxpayers ? they just have to sign a civil contract . so what if that person is the only person able to do marriage contracts in the area . how does the state ensure that gay people can __exersize__ their right to marriage if the only person able to perform the marriage is exempted from __perfoming__ the marriage based upon religious beliefs ? __s1__ just think s2 are viewing this the wrong way -- making it more complicated than it is . it is simply a provision that allows a person to let someone else conduct the civil ceremony if their religious beliefs do n't allow them to do it . the same idea that would allow a jewish person to pass on eating pork if it were suddenly expected for him or her to do it when it was n't before . that 's all this is -- let 's not make mountains out of __molehills__ ... yet what if there is no one else in the community ? how is the government going to ensure gay people are able to __exersize__ their rights ? well , then __s1__ guess they need to ensure someone is there that will do it as well . gee , that darn religious freedom -- messing everything up , huh ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing a seemingly pending law that would permit marriage officials to decline to conduct gay marriages if they are opposed to them on religious principals . __s1__ finds it acceptable , while s2 complains about it . __s1__ proposes that it is easy for s2 to be unsympathetic because s2 dislikes religion . __s1__ acknowledges that he considers such religious objections to be evil . he suggests that because the individual licensed to perform a marriage is paid or licensed by the state , the individual should reflect the will and choices of the state and therefore perform gay marriages despite his or her personal religious objection to them . s2 suspects that the law may result in an effective denial of gay marriage .
generated -> s1 is not saying businesses ca n't legally do it to sit back and say what s1 are saying when s1 dislike religion , but this is no different than an employer telling a gay employee they ca n't legally do it . if s1 are going to be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality in all cases that

Article ->  who are __s1__ to say it is unjust ? who are 5 people to say a law is unjust ? we have a system that says the most votes for something wins . . we are the ones being oppressed by the majority that is who we are . it is our lives that are on the ballot and our rights that our being denied that is who we are . we are the ones who are being told we are second __calss__ citizens . we are the ones who are being told are families are not families . we are the ones who are told we are less then dirt . of course being a heterosexual __s1__ would not understand . __s1__ suggest s2 get a majority of people and change the law then . this is what happened during slavery ... they actually passed 3 amendments about it . the courts are n't the all knowing group of people that have enlightened minds about what is or is n't fair . s2 's whole case is based on saying the majority is always be ignored if someone objects to them . __s1__ am in the minority when it comes to abortion ... does this mean the court should listen to me and declare abortion illegal ? no because abortion does not effect __s1__ 's life personally . that __iis__ __waht__ we mean the courts should look at the __individuials__ life and decide upon that . if a law that the majority favors is unjust in an __individuials__ life then it must be over ruled for the __individuials__ sake . what ? that makes no sense . if a law is unjust to one person then it needs to be overruled ? of course __unjustice__ is defined by the person in question . s2 make no sense here . s2 still fail to understand how our courts work too . s2 want them to work a certain way as opposed to the way they were created under our constitution . __s1__ want a society that __oppresses__ people . if the law effects even one person __adversly__ then it is unjust and needs to be overturned . it only goes to prove that conservatives are heartless and want people to suffer . __s1__ want a society that is free to make laws and rules as it sees fit . __s1__ guess we __oppress__ child __molesters__ but __s1__ am ok with that .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ , a heterosexual , and s2 , a homosexual , discuss the !!__justness__!! of the legislative process , majority rule , and how the latter affects individuals and the gay community . s2 describes how the gay community is discriminated against , and !!__posits__!! that because laws regarding homosexuals impact them more directly than the general population , it is unfair to have a majority rule apply . __s1__ accuses s2 of not understanding the legal system and proposes that s2 find majority to have legislation passed , and not look to the courts to redress the discrimination . __s1__ !!__analogizes__!! that process to how slavery was abolished , and also !!__analogizes__!! the alleged oppression to the oppression that may be felt by anti-abortion advocates and child !!__molesters__!! as a result of majority rule .
generated -> unjust ? we are the ones who are being told are families are not families . s1 suggest s2 get a majority of people and change the law then . if a law is unjust to one person then it needs to be overruled ? no because abortion does not effect s1 's life personally that

Article ->  __s1__ wish . but however much __s1__ disagree with sullivan on many political issues , he 's right about that . the world did change when the mass. legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights . it may be a big change in a small state , but it is a recognition that the winds of change are blowing against homophobic bigotry . __s1__ are just going to have to get over it . the world just is n't as anti-gay as it used to be . and that means that __s1__ are going to have to accept equal rights eventually , as gay marriage . presumably __s1__ will hope than in a few years , bigots in massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality . __s1__ think you 'll be out of luck . __s1__ wish that s2 wish . do __s1__ just like to argue for the sake of being argumentative ? __s1__ have picked out the one single thing s2 said there that __s1__ could disagree with and are making an issue of it , not even willing to agree on anything else s2 said . but fine , go ahead and think this is some __world-changing__ event if it makes __s1__ feel better . well , clearly __s1__ did n't even read s2 's post . -lrb- shrug -rrb- s2 have often posted here that s2 oppose gay marriage . that means s2 oppose equal rights for gays . if s2 have changed s2 's mind , and hope that massachusetts does n't overturn gay marriage , s2 would have said so . since s2 did n't , s2 do n't . no , __s1__ said __s1__ s2 '' will hope than in a few years , bigots in massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality '' . s2 had said , very plainly , that s2 think such legislation is an __over-intrusion__ by the government . clearly __s1__ did n't read s2 's post . are s2 claiming now s2 are in favour of legal marriage for gays in massachusetts now the legislature has voted for it ? because if so , that would be a change . s2 is saying that s2 would not want an amendment put in place banning it , because that would be an __over-intrusion__ into peoples ' lives by the government . so naturally , s2 would n't want such an amendment voted into creation , either , and that 's why s2 took issue with __s1__ 's claim that s2 would . that 's been s2 's position here for as long as s2 remember . and it 's a true conservative position -lrb- as opposed to __neocon__ -rrb- , __btw__ . are s2 saying that s2 are not in favour of a government ban on gay marriage ? s2 oppose doma laws ? does that mean s2 are now , contrary to s2 's previous posts , in favour of legal recognition of gay marriage ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing a legislative action associated with a massachusetts court ruling which is favorable to gay rights . __s1__ is enthusiastic about the matter and sees it as a step in the right direction against bigotry , and a recognition that the world is not as anti-gay as it used to be , which s2 is advised to acknowledge and accept . __s1__ also accuses s2 of being inconsistent in having been on the record on the website opposing gay marriage -lrb- and !!__therefor__!! according to __s1__ being opposed to equal rights for gays -rrb- , but now also taking a position that the state should not intervene to ban gay marriage . s2 defends that position and argues it is based on conservative principles against intrusions into individual lives .
generated -> the world did change when the mass. legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights . it may be a big change in a small state , but it may be a big change in a small state , but it is a recognition that the winds of change are blowing against homophobic bigotry .

Article ->  certainly not yours . s2 should know that __s1__ am for no marriage in government . it should be left to a religious institution where it will actually mean something . the states should then go back to doing something that actually makes sense and does n't reward people like britney spears for being white trash . that is all well and good , but it is not the religious ceremony and sanction that gays are looking for . they already have that ; there are churches that perform same-sex marriages . it is the civil benefits that are at issue . are __s1__ saying __s1__ would be in favor of __foregoing__ all the legal rights and benefits __s1__ are afforded by marriage ? for example * assumption of spouse s pension * automatic inheritance * automatic housing lease transfer * bereavement leave * burial determination * child custody * crime victim s recovery benefits * divorce protections * domestic violence protection * exemption from property tax on partner s death * immunity from testifying against spouse * insurance breaks * joint adoption and foster care * joint bankruptcy * joint parenting -lrb- insurance coverage , school records -rrb- * medical decisions on behalf of partner * certain property rights * reduced rate memberships * sick leave to care for partner * visitation of partner s children * visitation of partner in hospital or prison * wrongful death -lrb- loss of consort -rrb- benefits what do s2 say ? yeah __s1__ know . __s1__ is saying that there should be a better system . for example , if had a best friend who are roommates with ... both __hetero__ for the sake of argument ... and never wish to get married then could they get some of the benefits described ? __s1__ 's uncle actually was single until he died but he had a female friend who he was best friends with ... why could n't they get some kind of benefits if they so choose ? hospital __vistiation__ rights and things of that nature are obviously the most important in this kinda situation . it just seems the single folks are the ones getting screwed over in the marriage deal but gay folks are not ? to the single folks , s2 say get married . ok , lets use that logic ... . to the gay folks __s1__ say marry a woman . bet s2 are n't happy with that if want the benefits of marriage , get married . but ought to be able to marry a person of 's choice . 's suggestion would be to marry someone s2 do n't want to me married to , that is a different thing . it is not using '' that logic '' . s2 thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you . is n't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities ? s2 am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly . s2 happen to think that 's a bad idea . people get married for many reasons , some of which s2 would feel are not good reasons , but s2 would not make it illegal to do so . s2 am talking about the right to marry a person of 's choosing .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 discuss the civil benefits of marriage and how they could or could not be extended to single people and gay people . __s1__ is initially against government being involved in the equation , but after s2 describes many of the legal rights and benefits associated with marriage , such as automatic inheritance and hospital visitation rights , __s1__ is then able to relate to the issues by considering the case of his life-long bachelor uncle , suggesting that it is single people who are discriminated against by being excluded from the marriage benefits . s2 suggests that if a single person desires the benefits of marriage , they should marry , but that they should be able to marry a person of either gender as they see fit .
generated -> s2 should know that s1 am for no marriage in government . the states should then go back to doing something that actually makes sense and does n't reward people like britney spears for being white trash . it is the civil benefits that are at issue .

Article ->  it seems to me that the point there is that it is not a bigot ... er , spade merely because __s1__ call it a spade . __imo__ , if someone has to resort to name-calling , it tends to only indicate they are having to resort to something besides sound arguments . oh my . perhaps we should say it 's an anti-gay bias , or a person with an __anit-gay__ bias ? are the terms __acceptance-challenged__ , __inclusion-challenged__ , anti-discrimination challenged , appealing to you ? e __mutz__ or his '' joe '' , assumed those protesting against gay discrimination are nuts or trying to hijack heritage , but wo n't say why . if it walks like a duck and __quacks__ like a duck , chances are ... or maybe he 's simply arguing a different point than you . __imo__ it 's just simply arrogant of s2 to automatically write off disagreement as '' bigotry '' . your view is that this is about '' acceptance '' ; but that does n't mean that 's the real issue . e __mutz__ is right in saying that disagreement is not the same as bigotry . what is the basis for the disagreement or the different point of view if it is not a lack of acceptance of homosexuality or its visible and open displays and representations ? but the problem is that s2 insist on always __mischaracterizing__ that as bigotry . it 's a very ugly word , and __s1__ suspect that 's the reason s2 use it -lrb- for its effect -rrb- and why s2 do n't entertain the idea that bigotry may not always be what 's behind it . s2 say it is , and s2 explain why . replace the word '' gay '' with another minority , and tell me it is not . it 's an ugly thing . s2 have explained why s2 believe that 's what 's behind it . if __s1__ believe do n't believe that , why do n't __s1__ tell me what is behind it ? __s1__ think it all goes back to one 's motivations . what __s1__ do n't think s2 and some others understand is that people often do n't take that stand on the basis of not liking gay people . they do it because of the way they view marriage . if any other minority came along wanting marriage to be changed from one man and one woman , __s1__ suspect they had get the same response . we were n't just discussing marriage specifically . somehow whenever gays are involved , a group of people take a stand of being opposed , because of the way they view one thing or another in society , as being __straight-only__ , or excluding gays . yes , from the anti-gay crowd , sorry those who do n't wish to include gays . however , no other identified minority would want that , because only one minority identifies as gay . but it 's not always about __not-including-gays__ . that 's not the basis in many cases . -lrb- hey , that rhymes ! -rrb- it 's about the way they view marriage ! they had be that way toward any group wanting to change marriage to fit themselves if it changed marriage from the traditional view . __s1__ assure s2 if there was a movement afoot in this country by __polygamists__ to change marriage to include them , there would be a similar reaction toward that . it 's not that s2 are gay . it 's that s2 want to redefine marriage . ah , there 's no use . __s1__ have tried to get s2 to see this before .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that it is inappropriate to label disagreement as bigotry , and that while someone might think an argument is bigoted , it may be motivated by something other than bigotry . he argues that many people 's opinions are based on their view of marriage , not their dislike of homosexuals , and that they would be against any group wanting to alter the traditional view of marriage . s2 claims that opponents of gay rights are discriminatory and bigoted . he suggests that if you replaced gays with another minority , then the arguments against them would appear negative -lrb- e. g. , trying to exclude any other minority from getting married would not be acceptable -rrb- . he believes that opponents of gay marriage are not protecting traditional marriage , but are discriminating against homosexuals .

Article ->  yet s2 still will not answer the question . how does equal marriage hurt her or any heterosexual ? if she has her way __s1__ am the one that is hurt . __s1__ 's way of equal marriage __s1__ am not hurt nor is she . yes s2 did , in this post . s2 __summarize__ so what if a proposed law '' hurts '' you ? there are all kinds of laws that '' hurt '' all kinds of people . but is glad to see that s2 abandoned s2 's silly argument that it would be a violation of the first amendment to enact her religious belief about marriage , but not a violation of the first amendment to enact your religious belief about marriage . now , if s2 could only justify why only laws which do not cause '' harm '' to others are allowed to be enacted . frankly am astounded by s2 's affinity for the '' harm principle '' when s2 say things like '' do n't know about the '' culture war '' but am at war with evangelical anti gay christianity . will do whatever it takes to knock then down . '' because __s1__ am only concerned with rights of gay people . gay people are __s1__ 's first concern . this evil woman should come out and __sayshe__ is anti gay . she should come out and say she does n't want gay people to get married . she should admit that she wants gay people to remain second class citizens . why does n't she own up to her discrimination ? she wants to protect her heterosexual __privledge__ . for the record __s1__ own that statement and stand behind it . __s1__ will talk people out of attending these bible churches . __s1__ will do what __s1__ can to legally disrupt any __rundrasining__ activities they have going . __s1__ will protest their wedding ceremonies . __s1__ will protest their church services . as far as __s1__ am concerned , once they crossed over the line and started pushing for and getting laws enacted that hurt me , __s1__ 's family , __ands__ __s1__ 's people , they have no place in society . and __s1__ have yet to show why this is not a legitimate viewpoint , nor a legitimate way to legislate this issue . it 's obvious that all __s1__ care about is gay people . however , __s1__ have not shown why anti-gay -lrb- as __s1__ call them -rrb- people should not be able to legislate their view . all __s1__ have said is that __s1__ do n't like their view . big deal , they do n't like __s1__ 's view either . thus , in a democracy like ours , the majority of people decide issues like this . besides that , s2 think coming out in support of a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage qualifies as '' com -lsb- ing -rsb- out and say -lsb- ing -rsb- that she does n't want gay people to get married . '' this is fine . but also understand that it is legitimate for people who believe like ms. __musgrave__ to do the same , including to use the democratic process to have her view enacted in law . if __s1__ are free to do it , then she is as well . should the majority have the right to __enslave__ their fellow citizens ? should the majority have the right to lock people up in concentration camps ? a majority of the people in the us once thought it was a good idea . oh __s1__ want the evil woman to say it . __s1__ want her __viciousness__ and ugliness out in the open . if she is anti gay then she needs to own up to her bigotry repent america believes in protesting and disrupting gay gatherings . why if they can do this __s1__ can do the same . the majority did have the legal right -lrb- unfortunately -rrb- to __enslave__ their fellow citizens until the 13 th amendment took that option off the table . incidentally , it took a majority of people to take slavery off of the table . in the united states , the majority wins -lrb- for good or for ill -rrb- . s2 hope __s1__ are not trying to make a comparison between the denial of marriage to gays -lrb- and to 10 year olds , and to those who are currently married yet want another husband / wife , and to those who wish to marry their father , etc. -rrb- on the one hand , and slavery and / or concentration camps on the other . ok , and what would that accomplish ? yeah , that 's exactly what s2 said .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are talking about how democracy is based on majority rule and whether or not its fair . __s1__ believes it is completely unfair that gay marriage be dismissed or disliked and s2 argues that no matter what __s1__ believes is right or wrong , the majority of people control what is normal in our society . that if __s1__ is only towards the rights of gay people it is completely understandable for this lady to be in belief that marriage as is is fine . s2 believes that __s1__ 's argument is not a legitimate viewpoint because __s1__ has no justification that this lady hates gays . __s1__ believes that because this lady is not in favor of gay marriage , the lady is anti-gay . __s1__ is taking an aggressive approach by saying they will talk to bible churches and disrupt them because she feels like she has no place in society . __s1__ thinks that the majority of people is !!__enslaving__!! their people by not allowing gay rights , but s2 argues that it happens that way and it changes over time .
generated -> equal marriage hurt her or any heterosexual ? if she has her way s1 am the one that is hurt her or any heterosexual ? if a proposed law '' hurts '' you ? there are all kinds of laws that it would be a violation of the first amendment to enact her religious belief about marriage , but not a violation of the first amendment to enact her religious belief about marriage .

Article ->  agreed she is ignoring __s1__ 's religious freedom and trying to institute her religion into law . the law that will bar __s1__ 's family from legal protections . it wo n't protect her marriage but will bar me and __s1__ 's people from from being full citizens . she is n't protecting marriage but __perserving__ her heterosexual __privledge__ . how on earth is she impeding on __s1__ religious freedom ? she is n't trying to take away __s1__ 's right to any religious ceremony . with such a wide-open standard of what constitutes religious freedom that __s1__ seem to have , any legislation could be construed as imposing on religious freedom . because it is her religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman . __s1__ 's religious belief is that marriage is between two people that love each other regardless of sex . she is tying to place her religious __belif__ into law over mine . who gets hurt here ? if __s1__ 's religious belief is put into law she can still marry the person of her choice . if her religious belief gets put into law she can still marry the person of her choice but __s1__ do not get to . so __s1__ and __s1__ 's people are hurt by __codifing__ her religious belief into law . she is trying to keep gay people out of marriage and thus preserve her heterosexual __privledge__ . but by that definition , either one could be viewed as impeding on religious freedom , including __s1__ 's view impeding on hers ! we do n't define imposing on religious freedom on the basis of having different ideals . it does n't effect __s1__ 's religion or religious freedom if __s1__ do n't get benefits under gay marriages . __s1__ can argue in other ways , on other basis , but the idea that not giving gays marriage benefits is imposing on religious freedom is an empty '' argument '' . but s2 have not shown how she would be harmed by equal marriage ? __s1__ have shown that her definition infringes upon __s1__ 's religious freedom . if gay marriage becomes a reality then in no way does it infringe upon her in any way . would s2 care to explain how gay marriage infringes upon her in any way ? it is her heterosexual __privledge__ and her __sence__ of entitlement that she is protecting not marriage . __s1__ may -lrb- or may not -rrb- can show harm in another sense , but __s1__ certainly have not shown how __s1__ 's religious rights are taken away or harmed , to begin with . that 's the point . __s1__ certainly have not shown how her definition infringes upon __s1__ 's religious freedom -- __s1__ are still free to be just as religious in practice and belief as ever if __musgrave__ 's views became law . __s1__ are trying to use a religious freedom argument here and it just does n't fit . yes __s1__ have . have n't s2 been __poaying__ attention ? -rsb- because it is her religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman . __s1__ 's religious belief is that marriage is between two people that love each other regardless of sex . she is tying to place her religious __belif__ into law over mine . who gets hurt here ? if __s1__ 's religious belief is put into law she can still marry the person of her choice . if her religious belief gets put into law she can still marry the person of her choice but __s1__ do not get to . so __s1__ and __s1__ 's people are hurt by __codifing__ her religious belief into law . she is trying to keep gay people out of marriage and thus preserve her heterosexual __privledge__ . ok ! s2 's religious belief says that it 's important to smoke in public __non-smoking__ areas . s2 's religious belief says that it 's important to drive cars as fast as one can on city streets . s2 's religious belief says that the death penalty should never be enforced . gee , this it fun , using religion as an excuse and means to an end to fight legislation ! too bad for __s1__ it does n't work that way . what __s1__ do n't get is that , by __s1__ 's standard , either would be placing one religion over another . the same justification could be made against __s1__ 's view because __s1__ 's view goes against my religious belief . and then if __s1__ say '' but __s1__ 's view causes harm and mine does n't '' then it 's no longer a religious issue so the point is moot to begin with . you missed the point here she is trying to turn her religious belief into law that bars me from from getting married . how is she hurt if it is __s1__ 's religious belief of equal marriage is turned into law ? __s1__ have no idea whether or not she is truly trying to turn her religious belief into law . she may just happen to believe that way religiously , but be pushing for the law because she thinks that 's best for __socety__ . __iow__ , __s1__ have no idea if religion is her real motivation for the law . there 's no way to know or to police someone 's real motivations . __s1__ am part of society and her belief is not in __s1__ 's best __intrest__ . how does __s1__ 's being able to marry a man hurt her in any way ?
ref_sum ->  this is about gay marriage . __s1__ seems to believe that someone is making religion into law by saying marriage should be between a heterosexual couple . s2 is arguing that __s1__ 's point is not very valid because __s1__ is not understanding that they are not using the persons perspective . __s1__ believes that that person is trying to hurt them , while s2 is saying that the person may not necessarily be that way and that the person may be arguing for what they believe to be greater for society , based on their own perspective . __s1__ 's religious view of marriage is based on two people 's love for each other , while the other person believes its between a man and woman . s2 says __s1__ 's argument is empty and that __s1__ is not showing how the other person is being hurt by gay marriage . s2 thinks __s1__ is not understanding the overall perspectives and just focusing on their own needs . __s1__ states that the person 's religion put into law affects peoples ability to marry if they are gay , but that __s1__ 's religion on marriage put into law would not affect marriage for anyone .
generated -> the law that will bar s1 's family from legal protections . it wo n't protect her marriage but will bar me and s1 's people from being full citizens . she is trying to keep gay people out of marriage and thus preserve her heterosexual privledge that

Article ->  __lesz__ , __s1__ 's marriage means a great many things to me , none of which have anything to do with our governments . __s1__ 's question to s2 is what do __s1__ think marriage should mean to our governments ? well , marriage is an ancient human institution , based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans , and is one of the foundations of social stability . why would it surprise anyone that government might wish to support it ? what really surprises me is to find how many alleged christians now find it __expedient__ to demand government '' get out of marriage '' , simply because gay people want to get in it . bunch of hypocrites -- they never complained about government regulating marriage before this . now , while s2 agree it is n't absolutely essential for government to be involved in the regulation and support of marriage , it is nevertheless a convenience that few people would really want to throw away . -lrb- mr. __writela__ has summed it up eloquently so s2 need n't elaborate . -rrb- alas , many are just too mean-spirited to share marriage with those pesky __homos__ , so they have jumped on the __get-out-of-marriage__ bandwagon -- which is n't going to go anywhere -- as camouflage for their real feelings . that government would wish to be involved in any aspect of our lives , would not surprise me . that is what governments tend to do . consider the '' healthy marriage initiative '' . this is our government and as citizens , we would be well advised to exercise vigilance to prevent our government from __intruding__ into areas where there is no necessity . just because a few mean-spirited hypocrites may advocate that the government get out of marriage for the wrong reasons does not mean that the idea is all bad . never happen ? enlist the 100 single people who have the biggest stake in this issue and chip away at the exclusive benefits . start with an easy one like hospital visitation and work up to the tough ones like social security to spouses why ? why is it in the interests of society to prevent government involvement in marriage ? that 's what __s1__ have n't explained . __mrwritela__ pointed out the reasons that government involvement is pretty much unavoidable , if only because government is the source of law . it seems to me __s1__ advocate the replacement of marriage with a plethora of minor and specific legal contracts that would only benefit the lawyers writing them . it 's the wood and the trees . if specific laws are trees , then marriage is the forest that protects our relationships from such gales that xxxx . is there any specific advantage to looking to individual trees and ignoring the wood ? __lesz__ __s1__ ask why and s2 ask why not . why should government get out of the marriage business 1 . it is not needed 2 . the current marriage benefits are terribly unfair to single people that are forced to pay for them . __s1__ 's __eloquence__ notwithstanding , have found it useful to look very closely at the trees when solving problems . would suggest that one can not understand the wood unless one knows something about trees . also , have often found it useful to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller parts and solving the easiest parts first . why is government support of marriage unfair to single people ? single people do not have the same issues as married people . having been married and single myself , s2 do have some insight here . and why would rather married people go to lawyers for multiple legal contracts to cover all the hundreds of rights and mutual obligations currently conferred by marriage ? are a lawyer in need of clients ? __;-rrb-__ s2 's own experience of woods and trees is that there is no value in looking at them in only one way . one needs to consider them as trees and woods . __s1__ have also been single and married . experience but not much insight . __s1__ would be interested to hear s2 's views about this difference in issues and how these issues are helped by government involvement . __lesz__ , __s1__ am an engineer , not a lawyer . well , single people live by themselves , not as a family . by definition , they do not have a significant relationship -- and no , s2 do n't count boyfriends or girlfriends here , s2 am referring to committed couples who live together as a family unit . there are many legal issues such as inheritance , pension and social security rights , adoption and child custody , home ownership , etc. , which would need separate legal contracts without the umbrella of marriage . -lrb- and of course , even then such contracts would only be enforceable by government . -rrb- s2 myself had tremendous difficulties sorting out property issues with s2 's partner 's family after he died . it all but __bankrupted__ me , and there would n't have been any issue at all had it been legal for us to get married . we did have some legal contracts pertaining to the house , and wills , but alas they were n't good enough to get his family off s2 's back , because our legal relationship was trumped by his familial one . s2 am not saying it could n't be done piecemeal , tailor-made to suit each individual couple , but would n't that be excessively inconvenient -- for everyone but the lawyers ? whereas at __prresent__ , when __s1__ get married for a $ 25 license , hey presto , __s1__ get those protections and the lawyers have to defer their caribbean cruise .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are debating the topic of what marriage should mean to our government . __s1__ believes it is not a bad idea because they think it is not necessary for the government to be involved in most aspects of our lives , while s2 is questioning why it 's necessary to try and remove government involvement when it is unavoidable . __s1__ brings up that because several people are against the government due to gay marriage and not because it 's just marriage altogether , it does n't mean it 's not a bad idea to remove government intervention . __s1__ mentions the `` healthy marriage initiative '' and how it is n't necessary . s2 says that there is too much legal work and documents behind marriage in the government , such as inheritance , pension and social rights , etc. . , and that it would be a lot more work if the government did n't intervene , also stating that removing marriage from government will only benefit lawyers . both __s1__ and s2 have had experience with marriage , s2 states that marriage benefits are good because of government intervention .
generated -> marriage '' an ancient human institution , based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans , and is one of the foundations of social stability that alas , many are just too mean-spirited to share marriage with those pesky homos , so they have jumped on the get-out-of-marriage bandwagon . why is it in the interests of society to prevent government involvement in marriage ? that

Article ->  in the sense that saying one supports gay rights but not gay marriage , sure . but __s1__ have no problem with that inconsistency . however , s2 are for gay marriage , __ergo__ , it makes more sense s2 had be bothered by that inconsistency . but if not , fine . whatever ... -lrb- and yes , __s1__ know s2 have given me s2 's ' reasons ' . does n't mean there 's no inconsistency there . it just means s2 think it 's not something that should be challenged right now . -rrb- again , s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't understand why __s1__ keep saying it 's an '' inconsistency '' . it 's not a matter of it being a '' problem '' , but rather a question of why __s1__ repeatedly label it as an '' inconsistency '' . just to try to put this plainly . __s1__ and biden have both stated the same opinion . against gay marriage , but for gay rights in every other way . with __s1__ 's stated opinion statement , s2 do n't see an inconsistency . but __s1__ do see an inconsistency with __s1__ 's stated opinion statement . quite frankly , s2 really have n't seen __s1__ show an inconsistency yet . __s1__ have said '' inconsistency '' , but not show it . it 's a bit like saying '' frank is inconsistent on the abortion issue '' , but that 's it . it would be showing an inconsistency to show frank 's statement saying '' s2 am against all abortion '' , but then he has no problem with his wife getting an abortion cause she does n't want to lose her figure . nothing in his statement is '' inconsistent '' , __imo__ . if __s1__ say biden is '' inconsistent '' , __s1__ are also saying that about __s1__ 's position ... s2 know , if s2 are n't able to grasp the concept of the inconsistency of saying one is against gay marriage when saying they are for gay rights , __s1__ do n't know what else to say . it would be different if s2 did n't think gay marriage should be a right . but s2 do , so how could his position not be inconsistent to you ? to take s2 's abortion example , it would be like someone saying they are for reproductive / abortion rights , but yet being against it being legal for women to get an abortion at an abortion clinic . frankly , s2 are grasping at straws at this point . but that 's your position ... if __s1__ ca n't grasp that __s1__ are saying your own position is inconsistent , s2 do n't know what to say . yeah . __s1__ have no recollection of what s2 's position actually is , do you . as s2 have already explained to you , s2 see that a person can be for gay rights and against gay marriage . s2 see that a person can propose a compromise , that s2 personally would find acceptable . s2 ca n't tell __s1__ how many people have posted '' s2 do n't believe gay marriage is a right '' . if they also say '' s2 believe gays should have equal rights '' , there is no contradiction just cause s2 believe -lrb- let me repeat that , s2 believe -rrb- that gay marriage is a right . s2 think biden 's wrong . but his view is consistent . on another note , s2 am just amazed that __s1__ think __s1__ 's own position is inconsistent . s2 honestly had no idea ... are s2 just not reading the thread __????__ apparently not . let me repeat myself ... '' in the sense that saying one supports gay rights but not gay marriage , sure . '' __s1__ have already said __s1__ know it 's inconsistent , but that __s1__ do n't care . it 's not a pet issue for me . it is for you . yet s2 are far more concerned , it seems , about the inconsistency on __s1__ 's part than on biden 's part . yet it 's biden who 's s2 's candidate . stop the dishonesty of pretending __s1__ have n't already addressed that . actually , s2 did n't think __s1__ had recognized what __s1__ had admitted . next sentence __s1__ talked about biden ... '' more concerned '' ? s2 am arguing against the general position . it does n't matter who holds it . one of the points with biden , as explained in multiple points before , is how the perception of holding his feet to the fire could impact others ... if s2 could have a private one-on-one with biden , or if he logged on anonymously to this __web-site__ , s2 would discuss it with him just the same . quite frankly , the '' he 's our candidate '' thing is one of the things that takes precedent . see , we do n't approach these things as '' single issue '' type guys . we weigh the '' gay marriage opinion '' up against the impact of pushing him hard on it a few weeks away from election day , and balance the responding approach accordingly . s2 hear somewhere that '' single issue '' guys can be frowned upon . that ai n't us ...
ref_sum ->  it seems like they are discussing the inconsistency of each other 's arguments . __s1__ is getting annoyed and seems to just be arguing because they are `` venting '' while s2 is saying that the inconsistency is present and making all arguments invalid without proof . both __s1__ and s2 are for gay rights , s2 is stating that __s1__ is n't being consistent and `` admits '' to being inconsistent , while __s1__ is saying they do n't care about the inconsistency because of the point they are trying to get across . they bring up biden and abortion in ways that dont exactly fit the discussion , but just to show the inconsistency in each others opinions . s2 is saying they would handle this same situation with biden the exact same way because s2 is simply talking about perspective . __s1__ believes s2 is stating that __s1__ believes in gay marriage but not gay rights , which seems contradictory to __s1__ 's point . this argument does not have a set topic .
generated -> again , s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't mean there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency .

Article ->  because it 's all quite clear . decades of effort from the religious right , conservative republicans , and their like have made gay rights a poisoned topic . it 's a tragedy , but saying the right thing on this issue will cost s2 more votes than it will gain you , everyone knows it , and no one is going to do it . it 's politics 101 . the democrats , as a whole , want to do the right thing , but they know that if they say so too loudly they wo n't be in a position to do anything . they are forced to moderate their public stances so that they can get into positions where they can actually take action . this is of course a __generalization__ , but if s2 are talking about a political party as a whole that 's unavoidable . so , __s1__ are basically saying that biden was lying through his teeth when he said he does n't support gay marriage ? it was all just a lie to keep from losing votes ? interesting . possibly , __s1__ could n't say . certainly as a democrat he gets more benefit of the doubt than __s1__ would give a republican when it comes to gay rights , but __s1__ have n't __plumbed__ his record enough to say for sure . and let 's be honest here , s2 do not find the idea that a politician might be lying interesting . what s2 had prefer is that the candidates be honest about their views , whether it 's popular or unpopular . but even knowing we are talking about political candidates -lrb- who may lie to get votes -rrb- , when a candidate says something is his or her view , s2 think we have to take them at what they say when they answer a question like that so directly and emphatically . otherwise , there 's little point in asking questions to begin with other than maybe watching the reaction of body language and how they would respond under pressure , and so forth . political discourse has to operate to where when a candidate gives a given view as his or her view , they are taken at their word that is their view . '' no '' ca n't mean '' yes '' and so forth . no , that 's too __niave__ an approach . we know politicians are going to tell some lies , __s1__ trust that 's a given . we , as political consumers , ca n't simply take politicians at their word . if we want to make informed decisions about candidates we need to develop the skills to make useful judgement calls about what they are saying . we need to figure out how often they lie , what they lie about , how big their lies are . obviously we should n't need to do this , it would be great if we could actually take our politicians at their word . bad the sad reality is that we ca n't , not at this stage anyway . in this particular case , if biden says he does n't support gay marriage __s1__ is just as likely to think it 's because he knows that open support could cost him the white house as any other reason . it 's sad that such double speak is needed , __s1__ had love it if enough courageous politicians stood forth and ended the political need for lies , but until that wonderful day __s1__ is not going to be naive and take everything they say at their word , nor am __s1__ going to jump up and down and point fingers at every __falsehood__ . i 'll try to judge the politicians by their actions , and their lies by their magnitude , scope , and quantity . s2 think __s1__ are misunderstanding me -- s2 do n't mean s2 think we should assume they are going to always tell the truth -- s2 mean we should put the expectation on them to be honest . __iow__ , honesty is what we should demand . if we are n't even going to do that , there 's no point in ever asking a political candidate a direct question . knowing they are going to lie is n't the same as having the expectation on them to be honest . s2 really do n't think it 's too much to ask our candidates to say what their views are . __s1__ just said yourself '' we need to figure out how often they lie , what they lie about , how big their lies are '' so , obviously , __s1__ believe it 's not really good that they are lying . there would be little point in asking them questions if we are n't going to hold to them to some level of expectation that they are going to say what they mean . sure , they lie , but if the words of politicians mean nothing , there 's little point in even having political discourse . political cynicism is no excuse to not put expectations on our candidates to be honest with the american people .
ref_sum ->  this is about politics and whether or not the lie in order to get more votes . __s1__ believes politicians sometimes may lie as long as its what is the majority , while s2 is saying that s2 is more concerned with the honesty of the candidates rather than whether they are lying or not . s2 says we should expect them to be honest , because that is what we should want from politicians . __s1__ argues that politicians seem to lie in order to get the position they want or sway people to become popular , while s2 thinks that we should rely on them to make the right decision . __s1__ seems to think that s2 is making an argument for their belief , but s2 is just trying to be honest and show the other perspective . they argue about politicians lying through discussing when politicians are asked questions and how they answer them . s2 finishes by telling __s1__ we should not label politicians and expect them to do and say the right , honest thing .
generated -> conservative republicans say the right thing on this issue will cost s2 more votes than it will gain you , everyone knows it , and no one is going to do it . it 's politics 101 , but if s2 are talking about a political party as a whole that 's unavoidable . so , s1 are basically saying that biden was lying through his teeth when he said he does n't support gay marriage ?

Article ->  what sex is n't behaviour ? polygamy is not more acceptable by the standards of western society . __s1__ is not sure __s1__ would call it a significant factor of contemporary western society . it is significant in patriarchal societies . no court or government in western society has recognized marriage rights for __polygamists__ . should they ? what are western standards ? what were they 20 yrs ago ? what were they 100 yrs ago ? marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract . it 's not just for a heterosexual contract in the netherlands , belgium , most of canada , and probably not limited that way for much longer in sweden and spain . it wo n't be just for a heterosexual contract in mass. in may . there are married heterosexual couples who either choose to not have children , or can not have children . so it is not just for having a family unit with children either . this is n't europe . there __dirinking__ laws , __prostituition__ laws , and many other laws are different than ours . so are many other countries . if we want to talk about the world the over 90 % of the world does n't recognize homosexuality . mass is taking __stpes__ to ban it . hawaii did the same thing in 1997 and their legislature stopped it . s2 believe mass will do the same . a family is the basic unit in society traditionally consisting of two parents rearing their own or adopted children ; also any of various social units differing from but regarded as equivalent to the traditional family . we are talking about traditional families . a family can be just a wife and husband . it ca n't be two husbands . well , europe or canada is more similar to the u.s. than iran or saudi arabia or namibia . any steps will take years , after the legal marriages have already taken place , if those steps are even successful . single parent families are not generally viewed as traditional . yeah this country is more similar to anglo countries . what 's __s1__ 's point ? what happens in 2050 when they predict __minorites__ will be over 50 % of this country ? hawaii did it in a year . but it is __veiwed__ as natural look at the current __hoity-toity__ polls which show strong support for gay rights among those 18 - 29 . __s1__ do n't see polygamy as a value among minorities in the u.s. hawaii was different , as the legislature made changes against marriage for gays , while the stayed decision was being appealed to the supreme court . so is casual sex and rabies . we do n't judge something as good simply because it is natural . single parenthood is not viewed as the moral traditional ideal among conservatives . they do n't ask them about polygamy . also gays rights is more political than anything else . it does n't really matter does it . we 'll see in the end who 's right . single parent is natural . many husbands die early . that 's natural . __unwed__ mothers is not considered moral but it 's still natural . casual sex is natural but not rational . it will lead to other problems . rabies are viruses . rabies are n't even alive so how can __s1__ call that natural ?
ref_sum ->  s2 claims that marriage is defined as a family unit based on a heterosexual contract . __s1__ refutes this assertion , citing a number of countries which recognize same-sex marriage and compares the lack of reproductive potential for homosexual couples to a heterosexual couple that chooses not to have children or is unable to have children . he also argues that single parent families are not considered traditional and references a poll showing support for gay rights among the 18 - 29 demographic . s2 claims that a traditional family is composed of a husband and wife and that the laws of other countries are irrelevant to the laws of america . he argues that single parent families are natural and suggests that time will decide which side is right .
generated -> s1 is not sure s1 would call it a significant factor of contemporary western society that marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract that marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract that

Article ->  it 's a consideration for many reasons . it 's a tremendous new tax on businesses , the social security system and healthcare systems because this would create a new '' dependent class '' that does n't presently exist . make no mistake about it , gay marriage is about economics . any claims to the contrary are simply false . are __s1__ saying that gay people who pay into the same systems , should n't also benefit ? speaking of dependency , imagine a scenario where a gay person is in a same-sex marriage , that is not legally recognized . this person is also dependent on the other spouse . the marriage breaks up . now , the taxpayer must support the dependent partner , because the marriage was not legally recognized . if it were legal , the richer partner could have been made to support the poorer one , after divorce . same sex marriage marriage partners that are n't legally __mrried__ are called roommates . do we want to start giving benefits to all singles sharing apartments regardless of sexual bent ? that is a separate issue , and could also involve different sex people . we are not talking about singles , or __roomates__ , when we talk of marriage . s2 do n't see __roomates__ sharing an apartment arguing for such a recognition or responsibility . as much as many trust and care for their __roomates__ , it 's not by that much . no , we are not talking about marriage . we are talking about a relationship that some want us to all believe is a marriage . well , if __s1__ want to marry __s1__ 's dog , can i ? of course __s1__ ca n't . it all goes back to the definition of marriage and jack and jack ai n't it . here we go again . if these types of arguments are the best the right wing can come up with and just repeat and repeat ad __nauseum__ , then good luck . in mass. , in ontario , in british columbia , in quebec , in belgium and the netherlands , jack and jack are it . __s1__ is not a right winger . right wingers are way too far left for me . __s1__ is a __jeffersonian__ liberal . __s1__ believe in the constitution as written . they are only allowed in mass. because the '' people 's will '' has n't been heard yet . the majority of americans are against same sex marriage , no matter how s2 try to spin it , so __s1__ is guessing that the laws will be solidified so that any ambiguity is removed very soon . as for canada and the netherlands , __s1__ could care less . __s1__ do n't live or pay a dime in taxes to support either . are __s1__ speaking of the federal marriage __ammendment__ to the u.s. constitution ? everything s2 have heard indicates it 's a long shot . at any rate , it is just a guess what will or wo n't happen a few years in the future . s2 was just pointing out what was happening internationally -lrb- mass. is international for me , a canadian -rrb- .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that the issue of same-sex marriage is an economic issue because it would have negative effects on businesses , social security , and the healthcare systems . he compares homosexual partners to roommates and and demonstrates that you can not make marriage mean whatever you want by explaining that he is not legally allowed to marry his dog . he makes it clear that he believes same-sex marriage is wrong and claims that the majority of americans are also against same-sex marriage . s2 suggests that homosexual partners would not be a burden on the mentioned systems because they would be paying into the systems as well as receiving benefits from them . he cites the legalization of same-sex marriages in various other countries in europe and north america .
generated -> tremendous new tax on businesses , the social security system and healthcare systems because this would create a new '' dependent class '' that does n't presently exist . make no mistake about it , gay people who pay into the same systems , should n't also benefit ? speaking of dependency , imagine a scenario where a gay person is in a same-sex marriage , that is not legally recognized that

Article ->  they did leave in a very key statement in the provision essentially making it __non-mandatory__ to some extent '' but it also says marriage officers need not perform a ceremony between same-sex couples if doing so would conflict with his or her '' conscience , religion and belief . '' -lrb- at least they have recognized that making officials do that may be infringing on their religious freedom . the link does n't work . this is unfortunate if it applies to public officials . s2 believe public officials are there to serve all members of the public , equally under the law . that 's their job . s2 is glad they have to do their job in canada . would __http__ want a public servant to refuse __http__ because he or she does not share __http__ 's evangelical beliefs , __jyoshu__ ? __s1__ certainly would not want someone forced to do something against their religious beliefs . if __s1__ went to a public official and it were against their religious belief to perform a heterosexual civil ceremony , __s1__ had simply find someone that would , rather than try to force that person to do it . here 's the corrected link , by the way if one ca n't do the job , one should look for another job . apparently not , in south africa . __s1__ do n't see why marriage freedom should automatically trump religious freedom , and apparently sa feels the same way . do __s1__ agree with me then , that this is an impediment to the public servant doing his or her job ? this is nonsense . s2 is glad s2 live in canada , where the religion of others is not imposed into s2 's life .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ cites a key statement in the same-sex marriage legislation that allows marriage officers the right not to perform a same-sex marriage if it conflicts with their conscience , religion , or beliefs . he believes this is a good caveat , claiming that forcing officials to perform same-sex marriages would be infringing upon their religious freedom . he argues that if a public official had a religious objection to heterosexual marriages , then he would not expect that person to perform his marriage and would instead seek out someone who would . s2 believes it is inappropriate for public officials to be able to deny services based on their personal religious beliefs . if they are unable to do their job , he suggests , they should not be able to hold that position .

Article ->  the number of __earthquales__ that have happened outside of israel in the last 100 yrs is exponentially increased . believe what __s1__ will . if __s1__ have a better understanding of love waxing cold __s1__ had like to hear it . obviously we do n't have the __smae__ understanding of the us government . teh majority rules unless it violates the constitution . if __s1__ can point out how that is n't true then __s1__ had be interested in being enlightened . lol . ok , if s2 say so . __waxy__ looked at the lists of '' world 's most dangerous earthquakes and selected earthquakes in the united states '' from the citizen 's guide to geologic hazards . __s1__ thought it best to look just at the larger earthquakes to reduce the dependence on instruments and observers . there has been about 20 large earthquakes globally in the latter half of this century -lrb- so far -rrb- compared to about 15 for the first half of this century . there were only 7 large earthquakes recorded for the entire 19th century . based on this quick look at one source of information , it does appear that the frequency of earthquakes is increasing . __mana'ia__ , s2 can only shake s2 's at __s1__ sometimes . did the idea of how they detect and record earthquakes taking exponential leaps forward ever occur to you ? of course not , s2 saw a stat that s2 liked , from one source , and without any critical thought at all , s2 immediately accepted it as being solid truth / evidence and based an entire argument on it . it is rather typical of s2 's posts though . __waxy__ actually __s1__ did take __taht__ fact __inot__ consideration . the new __methoods__ detect min or earthquakes and mostly do it in remote places . __s1__ is talking ab out teh major earthquakes __taht__ could be detected __wihtout__ a __seizmograph__ in the major countries in the civilized world . the evidence of teh earthquakes that could be measured in the 1800 s in teh countries documented compared to __thiose__ same earthquakes now are __expontially__ increasing . we __doin__ ; t need to count the minor ones in remote places . go to any and all sources and count them . __s1__ did __s1__ 's research but obviously did n't . still remember that also are only __specualting__ __thqat__ it the reason for more . __mana'ia__ , see s2 's first response to __s1__ 's earthquake nonsense . research hey __waxy__ that is the only argument s2 have but it is n't supported by the facts . show me if s2 can that it is n't . also s2 are only __specualting__ especially after s2 claimed it was n't true .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that the number of earthquakes occurring outside of israel has increased in the last hundred years , comparing 20 large earthquakes in the latter half of the 20th century to only 15 large earthquakes in the first half of the 20th century , and only 7 large earthquakes in the entire 19th century . __s1__ argues that this information is clear evidence that the frequency of earthquakes is increasing over time . s2 refutes __s1__ claim of increasing earthquake frequency , suggesting that the greater number of earthquakes detected could be a matter of increases in our ability to detect earthquakes rather than an actual increase in the number of earthquakes occurring . __s1__ takes this point into consideration , but claims that the evidence still supports his original claim .

Article ->  fine , i 'll stand by the exact wording of __s1__ 's original post . who do __s1__ think made aids a major health concern in the us ? if __s1__ have anything via proof that it 's not true , bring it on . __s1__ welcome the debate . so far , all __s1__ have seen is attempts to change the debate , attack me personally or make unsubstantiated statements that do n't mean __####__ . okay , you 'll get an answer to this question . first off , no one knows how aids actually got to the us . secondly , as to who made aids a major health concern , they would be people who did n't clean their needles and such while doing drugs , and people who did not practice safe sex , as well those giving blood transfusions before it was known that hiv / aids could be spread through blood . no more , no less . do s2 have something of substance to back s2 's claim or are s2 going to stick with s2 's opinion only ? well for that , we 'll have to quote one of __s1__ 's recent posts __s1__ is still waiting for anything of content to stream from 's keyboard . __s1__ guess i 'll just grow old waiting for a pearl of wisdom to flow from 's fingers . here __s1__ go so the best can do for an intelligent statement is quote me ? __s1__ is flattered . now , when do want the debate to start or are still afraid ? the debate will start once __s1__ personally own up to __s1__ 's own requirements of others . until then , s2 will continue to note the hypocrisy in __s1__ expecting others to defend something when __s1__ yourself are unwilling to do the same with __s1__ 's statement . once __s1__ follow __s1__ 's '' __bizarro__ '' rules -lrb- as __kronus__ so eloquently put it -rrb- , then s2 will get a debate . __irf__ accept __s1__ 's challenge , __s1__ guarantee that i 'll prove __s1__ 's assertion in the debate . is that good enough for you ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ challenges s2 to debate the cause of the spread of aids in the united states and encourages s2 to attempt to challenge his claims with proof that they are untrue . he accuses s2 of attempting to change the debate and making personal attacks rather than addressing the question at hand . he suggests that if the debate occurs , he will prove his assertions true . s2 claims that the origin of aids in the united states is unknown and that the spread of aids was caused by unclean needles , unprotected sex , and contaminated blood transfusions . he rejects the requirement that he should provide proof for his claims by citing __s1__ 's failure to do so . he suggests that once __s1__ begins to debate appropriately , then he will too .
generated -> the debate will start once s1 personally own up to s1 's own requirements of others . until then , s2 will continue to note the hypocrisy in s1 expecting others to defend something when s1 yourself are unwilling .

Article ->  so , then 2 gays people living together in va should n't expect healthcare , since a couple who is n't married does n't get it . '' thats just the way it is '' is n't much of an argument ! so , basically __s1__ do n't care that some people can have rights , while others who should have them do n't get them . so , s2 take it __s1__ liked segregation , __prohabition__ and prefer women barefoot in the kitchen rather than at the polls voting for anything . wow ! all s2 an say is wow . __s1__ is guessing s2 mean '' prohibition '' . gays do n't have the right to shared healthcare because they are not married ! gays have rights ... they can marry members of the opposite sex . nobody can marry members of the opposite sex , it 's not just gays . gays have all the rights that straight people do . __straights__ ca n't marry people of the same sex , and neither can gays . if __straigh__ people want __heatlcare__ , they can marry someone of the opposite sex ... so can gays ! we do n't have the right to marry who we love and if ya did n't notice it is n't someone of the same sex . what a __ridculous__ posts ! we are fighting to the right to marry , we will win , we will have healthcare and we are in __s1__ 's neighborhood too ! trust me , we are nor backing down to the __xtian__ right wing . we shall overcome ! haha !! it seems like '' s2 all '' are going in the wrong direction then . thousands of gays in san francisco recently had their marriages __enulled__ . a judge in seattle was also told he ca n't allow gays to get married . missouri just voted to outlaw gay marriage -lrb- 70 % of the people voted to ban it ... pretty alarming if s2 ask me -rrb- . how do s2 figure s2 are in the process to '' overcome '' ? it looks quite the opposite if s2 ask me . the only luck s2 have is moving to another country or moving to massachusetts . mark __s1__ 's word , there will never be a federal law allowing gay marriages in the us . that 's just what they said about slavery , women voting , __interacial__ marriage . it is what they said about people flying , looking for a cure to polio , it is always darkest before the dawn ! looking at slavery is incorrect . slavery was wrong because certain individuals who could n't change their color were targeted and often tortured . they were treated as property and had no rights . however , gays have the exact same rights as __heterosexuals__ and are not property , nor can they be targeted by color , etc. . women voting is also a terrible example . that has to do with free speech , which is an __unalienable__ right -lrb- last time __s1__ checked , gays being allowed to marry was n't an __unalienable__ right -rrb- . that was also when women could n't hold jobs and had to work in the home . gays do n't have to do that . interracial marriage goes along with slavery and is an absolutely terrible example . it was looked down upon , not illegal . thomas jefferson had children by a black woman .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that homosexual partners should n't expect shared healthcare in the same way that an unmarried couple should n't . he suggests that homosexuals are not being denied any rights , that they have all the same rights as !!__heterosexuals__!! . he points out that nobody can marry someone of the same sex , not just homosexuals . he rejects the idea that homosexuals will succeed in legalizing same-sex marriage , citing several cases where homosexual marriages were banned . s2 accuses __s1__ of accepting that some people should not receive the basic right to marry the person they love . he likens this to slavery , prohibition , and women 's suffrage . he claims that the proponents of same-sex marriage will eventually be successful , just as human rights advocates were with slavery , voting , and interracial marriage .

ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that because healthcare is generally extended to spouses , homosexuals will not be eligible to receive healthcare through their partner because same-sex marriages are not recognized in virginia . he likens this situations to a heterosexual male with a girlfriend who would not receive his healthcare benefits . he presents his opinion that homosexuals should move out of virginia and his hope that same-sex marriages will be made illegal everywhere . s2 argues that the cases presented by __s1__ are not equivalent because the heterosexual male has the right to marry his girlfriend if he chooses , at which point she would be eligible for his benefits . he also points out that after !!__cohabitating__!! for a certain period of time , the woman would be eligible under common law marriage .

Article ->  __s1__ wish . but however much __s1__ disagree with sullivan on many political issues , he 's right about that . the world did change when the mass. legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights . it may be a big change in a small state , but it is a recognition that the winds of change are blowing against homophobic bigotry . __s1__ are just going to have to get over it . the world just is n't as anti-gay as it used to be . and that means that __s1__ are going to have to accept equal rights eventually , as gay marriage . presumably __s1__ will hope than in a few years , bigots in massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality . __s1__ think you 'll be out of luck . __s1__ wish that s2 wish . do __s1__ just like to argue for the sake of being argumentative ? __s1__ have picked out the one single thing s2 said there that __s1__ could disagree with and are making an issue of it , not even willing to agree on anything else s2 said . but fine , go ahead and think this is some __world-changing__ event if it makes __s1__ feel better . well , clearly __s1__ did n't even read s2 's post . -lrb- shrug -rrb- s2 have often posted here that s2 oppose gay marriage . that means s2 oppose equal rights for gays . if s2 have changed s2 's mind , and hope that massachusetts does n't overturn gay marriage , s2 would have said so . since s2 did n't , s2 do n't . no , __s1__ said __s1__ s2 '' will hope than in a few years , bigots in massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality '' . s2 had said , very plainly , that s2 think such legislation is an __over-intrusion__ by the government . clearly __s1__ did n't read s2 's post . are s2 claiming now s2 are in favour of legal marriage for gays in massachusetts now the legislature has voted for it ? because if so , that would be a change . s2 is saying that s2 would not want an amendment put in place banning it , because that would be an __over-intrusion__ into peoples ' lives by the government . so naturally , s2 would n't want such an amendment voted into creation , either , and that 's why s2 took issue with __s1__ 's claim that s2 would . that 's been s2 's position here for as long as s2 remember . and it 's a true conservative position -lrb- as opposed to __neocon__ -rrb- , __btw__ . are s2 saying that s2 are not in favour of a government ban on gay marriage ? s2 oppose doma laws ? does that mean s2 are now , contrary to s2 's previous posts , in favour of legal recognition of gay marriage ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing a legislative action associated with a massachusetts court ruling which is favorable to gay rights . __s1__ is enthusiastic about the matter and sees it as a step in the right direction against bigotry , and a recognition that the world is not as anti-gay as it used to be , which s2 is advised to acknowledge and accept . __s1__ also accuses s2 of being inconsistent in having been on the record on the website opposing gay marriage -lrb- and !!__therefor__!! according to __s1__ being opposed to equal rights for gays -rrb- , but now also taking a position that the state should not intervene to ban gay marriage . s2 defends that position and argues it is based on conservative principles against intrusions into individual lives .
generated -> the world did change when the mass. legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights . it may be a big change in a small state , but it may be a big change in a small state , but it is a recognition that the winds of change are blowing against homophobic bigotry .

Article ->  certainly not yours . s2 should know that __s1__ am for no marriage in government . it should be left to a religious institution where it will actually mean something . the states should then go back to doing something that actually makes sense and does n't reward people like britney spears for being white trash . that is all well and good , but it is not the religious ceremony and sanction that gays are looking for . they already have that ; there are churches that perform same-sex marriages . it is the civil benefits that are at issue . are __s1__ saying __s1__ would be in favor of __foregoing__ all the legal rights and benefits __s1__ are afforded by marriage ? for example * assumption of spouse s pension * automatic inheritance * automatic housing lease transfer * bereavement leave * burial determination * child custody * crime victim s recovery benefits * divorce protections * domestic violence protection * exemption from property tax on partner s death * immunity from testifying against spouse * insurance breaks * joint adoption and foster care * joint bankruptcy * joint parenting -lrb- insurance coverage , school records -rrb- * medical decisions on behalf of partner * certain property rights * reduced rate memberships * sick leave to care for partner * visitation of partner s children * visitation of partner in hospital or prison * wrongful death -lrb- loss of consort -rrb- benefits what do s2 say ? yeah __s1__ know . __s1__ is saying that there should be a better system . for example , if had a best friend who are roommates with ... both __hetero__ for the sake of argument ... and never wish to get married then could they get some of the benefits described ? __s1__ 's uncle actually was single until he died but he had a female friend who he was best friends with ... why could n't they get some kind of benefits if they so choose ? hospital __vistiation__ rights and things of that nature are obviously the most important in this kinda situation . it just seems the single folks are the ones getting screwed over in the marriage deal but gay folks are not ? to the single folks , s2 say get married . ok , lets use that logic ... . to the gay folks __s1__ say marry a woman . bet s2 are n't happy with that if want the benefits of marriage , get married . but ought to be able to marry a person of 's choice . 's suggestion would be to marry someone s2 do n't want to me married to , that is a different thing . it is not using '' that logic '' . s2 thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you . is n't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities ? s2 am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly . s2 happen to think that 's a bad idea . people get married for many reasons , some of which s2 would feel are not good reasons , but s2 would not make it illegal to do so . s2 am talking about the right to marry a person of 's choosing .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 discuss the civil benefits of marriage and how they could or could not be extended to single people and gay people . __s1__ is initially against government being involved in the equation , but after s2 describes many of the legal rights and benefits associated with marriage , such as automatic inheritance and hospital visitation rights , __s1__ is then able to relate to the issues by considering the case of his life-long bachelor uncle , suggesting that it is single people who are discriminated against by being excluded from the marriage benefits . s2 suggests that if a single person desires the benefits of marriage , they should marry , but that they should be able to marry a person of either gender as they see fit .
generated -> s2 should know that s1 am for no marriage in government . the states should then go back to doing something that actually makes sense and does n't reward people like britney spears for being white trash . it is the civil benefits that are at issue .

ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that the gay community is the cause of the aids epidemic in the us and that homosexuals and their advocates attempt to divert attention from this fact by tracing the origin of the disease to africa . he believes that the existence of aids in africa has nothing to do with aids in the us and that it should be ignored . s2 argues that discussing aids in africa is relevant to aids in the us and point out how aids is used as a justification for those who oppose gay rights . he suggests that the statistics regarding aids in africa show that it is not simply a homosexual disease and that aids should therefore not be used as a justification to make gay marriage illegal .

ref_sum ->  s2 suggests that he would be liberal if modern liberalism was actually __jeffersonian__ , meaning that democracy is viewed as the power of the people . he cites jefferson 's beliefs that war can be necessary in order to maintain liberty and that centralized government is a threat , and points out how these beliefs are the opposite of modern liberalism . he further claims that the current democratic party is __anti-religion__ , __over-regulatory__ , and controlled by the gay lobby . __s1__ !!__interprets__!! s2 's argument as a claim that fairness should exist for all people except homosexuals . s2 !!__clarifies__!! that he does support equal opportunity for all people regardless of their sexual behavior , but that he is still opposed to redefining the traditional view of marriage by legalizing same-sex marriage for homosexuals .

Article ->  what about the __domionists__ ? do they care about other people or do they just care about power ? s2 just did a google search and could n't find a __dominionist__ web site at all . the only articles s2 could find on this devious organization are from radical left leaning groups that s2 believe are making this group up as a red herring to create a reason to promote fear of christians . would __s1__ be so kind as to post a link to the __dominionist__ web site that outlines their agenda to take over the country ? just go to jerry __falwell__ or pat robertson and learn what s2 need to know . so what __s1__ are saying is that __s1__ ca n't produce one objective , independent site or source that is by the __dominionists__ themselves as evidence that they are an actual existing group or organization . if __s1__ could , __s1__ would have . this is just one more example of the diabolical agenda of the radical left to make people fear christianity based on more lies and deception . thanks for revealing who the real paranoid __fearmongers__ are . do s2 's own homework , buddy . then stop making assertions __s1__ ca n't back up with evidence . s2 already told __s1__ s2 googled it and found nothing at all by a __dominionist__ organization at all . but __s1__ implied it 's a real group so prove it or else do n't attempt to use it as a method of __demonizing__ christians as a group . the reason why __s1__ __lefties__ must lie and cheat to win is because the truth is __repugnent__ and foreign to you . and __samiinh__ , it 's fascinating that __s1__ posted that article but declined to post the link . how corrupt are __s1__ to with hold the link because it 's from a leftist site that os promoting the lie of the __dominionist__ 's existence without producing any more proof than __s1__ did . s2 could post a link on google right now asserting that all __lefties__ of the socialist , democratic party persuasion are in fact satan worshipers who sacrifice the babies they kidnap from republican christians on an alter to the devil at each full moon . posting it would n't make it true . even though on its surface it 's much more credible than __s1__ 's bogus story about christian __dominionists__ . now post a link with __s1__ 's __slanderous__ article or delete it for the lie that it is .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ suggests that a christian sect known as the __domionists__ are focused only on gaining power , citing jerry __falwell__ and pat robertson as his sources . s2 claims that he was unable to find any evidence of __domionists__ practices online except from left wing groups . he suggests that the !!__dimionists__!! are not a real religious group , but rather are a group invented by left wing groups to make people fear christianity , and further argues that left leaning individuals rely on lying to achieve their goals because they are unfamiliar with the truth . he also presents an absurd story about people on the political left being satan worshipers in order to demonstrate how posting information without evidence to back it up does not make it automatically true .
generated -> the only articles s2 could find on this devious organization are from radical left leaning groups that s2 believe are making this group up as a red herring to create a reason to promote fear of christians . would s1 be so kind as to post a link to the dominionist web site that outlines their agenda to take over the country ?

Article ->  what sex is n't behaviour ? polygamy is not more acceptable by the standards of western society . __s1__ is not sure __s1__ would call it a significant factor of contemporary western society . it is significant in patriarchal societies . no court or government in western society has recognized marriage rights for __polygamists__ . should they ? what are western standards ? what were they 20 yrs ago ? what were they 100 yrs ago ? marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract . it 's not just for a heterosexual contract in the netherlands , belgium , most of canada , and probably not limited that way for much longer in sweden and spain . it wo n't be just for a heterosexual contract in mass. in may . there are married heterosexual couples who either choose to not have children , or can not have children . so it is not just for having a family unit with children either . this is n't europe . there __dirinking__ laws , __prostituition__ laws , and many other laws are different than ours . so are many other countries . if we want to talk about the world the over 90 % of the world does n't recognize homosexuality . mass is taking __stpes__ to ban it . hawaii did the same thing in 1997 and their legislature stopped it . s2 believe mass will do the same . a family is the basic unit in society traditionally consisting of two parents rearing their own or adopted children ; also any of various social units differing from but regarded as equivalent to the traditional family . we are talking about traditional families . a family can be just a wife and husband . it ca n't be two husbands . well , europe or canada is more similar to the u.s. than iran or saudi arabia or namibia . any steps will take years , after the legal marriages have already taken place , if those steps are even successful . single parent families are not generally viewed as traditional . yeah this country is more similar to anglo countries . what 's __s1__ 's point ? what happens in 2050 when they predict __minorites__ will be over 50 % of this country ? hawaii did it in a year . but it is __veiwed__ as natural look at the current __hoity-toity__ polls which show strong support for gay rights among those 18 - 29 . __s1__ do n't see polygamy as a value among minorities in the u.s. hawaii was different , as the legislature made changes against marriage for gays , while the stayed decision was being appealed to the supreme court . so is casual sex and rabies . we do n't judge something as good simply because it is natural . single parenthood is not viewed as the moral traditional ideal among conservatives . they do n't ask them about polygamy . also gays rights is more political than anything else . it does n't really matter does it . we 'll see in the end who 's right . single parent is natural . many husbands die early . that 's natural . __unwed__ mothers is not considered moral but it 's still natural . casual sex is natural but not rational . it will lead to other problems . rabies are viruses . rabies are n't even alive so how can __s1__ call that natural ?
ref_sum ->  s2 claims that marriage is defined as a family unit based on a heterosexual contract . __s1__ refutes this assertion , citing a number of countries which recognize same-sex marriage and compares the lack of reproductive potential for homosexual couples to a heterosexual couple that chooses not to have children or is unable to have children . he also argues that single parent families are not considered traditional and references a poll showing support for gay rights among the 18 - 29 demographic . s2 claims that a traditional family is composed of a husband and wife and that the laws of other countries are irrelevant to the laws of america . he argues that single parent families are natural and suggests that time will decide which side is right .
generated -> s1 is not sure s1 would call it a significant factor of contemporary western society that marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract that marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract that

Article ->  it 's a consideration for many reasons . it 's a tremendous new tax on businesses , the social security system and healthcare systems because this would create a new '' dependent class '' that does n't presently exist . make no mistake about it , gay marriage is about economics . any claims to the contrary are simply false . are __s1__ saying that gay people who pay into the same systems , should n't also benefit ? speaking of dependency , imagine a scenario where a gay person is in a same-sex marriage , that is not legally recognized . this person is also dependent on the other spouse . the marriage breaks up . now , the taxpayer must support the dependent partner , because the marriage was not legally recognized . if it were legal , the richer partner could have been made to support the poorer one , after divorce . same sex marriage marriage partners that are n't legally __mrried__ are called roommates . do we want to start giving benefits to all singles sharing apartments regardless of sexual bent ? that is a separate issue , and could also involve different sex people . we are not talking about singles , or __roomates__ , when we talk of marriage . s2 do n't see __roomates__ sharing an apartment arguing for such a recognition or responsibility . as much as many trust and care for their __roomates__ , it 's not by that much . no , we are not talking about marriage . we are talking about a relationship that some want us to all believe is a marriage . well , if __s1__ want to marry __s1__ 's dog , can i ? of course __s1__ ca n't . it all goes back to the definition of marriage and jack and jack ai n't it . here we go again . if these types of arguments are the best the right wing can come up with and just repeat and repeat ad __nauseum__ , then good luck . in mass. , in ontario , in british columbia , in quebec , in belgium and the netherlands , jack and jack are it . __s1__ is not a right winger . right wingers are way too far left for me . __s1__ is a __jeffersonian__ liberal . __s1__ believe in the constitution as written . they are only allowed in mass. because the '' people 's will '' has n't been heard yet . the majority of americans are against same sex marriage , no matter how s2 try to spin it , so __s1__ is guessing that the laws will be solidified so that any ambiguity is removed very soon . as for canada and the netherlands , __s1__ could care less . __s1__ do n't live or pay a dime in taxes to support either . are __s1__ speaking of the federal marriage __ammendment__ to the u.s. constitution ? everything s2 have heard indicates it 's a long shot . at any rate , it is just a guess what will or wo n't happen a few years in the future . s2 was just pointing out what was happening internationally -lrb- mass. is international for me , a canadian -rrb- .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that the issue of same-sex marriage is an economic issue because it would have negative effects on businesses , social security , and the healthcare systems . he compares homosexual partners to roommates and and demonstrates that you can not make marriage mean whatever you want by explaining that he is not legally allowed to marry his dog . he makes it clear that he believes same-sex marriage is wrong and claims that the majority of americans are also against same-sex marriage . s2 suggests that homosexual partners would not be a burden on the mentioned systems because they would be paying into the systems as well as receiving benefits from them . he cites the legalization of same-sex marriages in various other countries in europe and north america .
generated -> tremendous new tax on businesses , the social security system and healthcare systems because this would create a new '' dependent class '' that does n't presently exist . make no mistake about it , gay people who pay into the same systems , should n't also benefit ? speaking of dependency , imagine a scenario where a gay person is in a same-sex marriage , that is not legally recognized that

Article ->  they did leave in a very key statement in the provision essentially making it __non-mandatory__ to some extent '' but it also says marriage officers need not perform a ceremony between same-sex couples if doing so would conflict with his or her '' conscience , religion and belief . '' -lrb- at least they have recognized that making officials do that may be infringing on their religious freedom . the link does n't work . this is unfortunate if it applies to public officials . s2 believe public officials are there to serve all members of the public , equally under the law . that 's their job . s2 is glad they have to do their job in canada . would __http__ want a public servant to refuse __http__ because he or she does not share __http__ 's evangelical beliefs , __jyoshu__ ? __s1__ certainly would not want someone forced to do something against their religious beliefs . if __s1__ went to a public official and it were against their religious belief to perform a heterosexual civil ceremony , __s1__ had simply find someone that would , rather than try to force that person to do it . here 's the corrected link , by the way if one ca n't do the job , one should look for another job . apparently not , in south africa . __s1__ do n't see why marriage freedom should automatically trump religious freedom , and apparently sa feels the same way . do __s1__ agree with me then , that this is an impediment to the public servant doing his or her job ? this is nonsense . s2 is glad s2 live in canada , where the religion of others is not imposed into s2 's life .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ cites a key statement in the same-sex marriage legislation that allows marriage officers the right not to perform a same-sex marriage if it conflicts with their conscience , religion , or beliefs . he believes this is a good caveat , claiming that forcing officials to perform same-sex marriages would be infringing upon their religious freedom . he argues that if a public official had a religious objection to heterosexual marriages , then he would not expect that person to perform his marriage and would instead seek out someone who would . s2 believes it is inappropriate for public officials to be able to deny services based on their personal religious beliefs . if they are unable to do their job , he suggests , they should not be able to hold that position .

ref_sum ->  __s1__ challenges s2 to debate the cause of the spread of aids in the united states and encourages s2 to attempt to challenge his claims with proof that they are untrue . he accuses s2 of attempting to change the debate and making personal attacks rather than addressing the question at hand . he suggests that if the debate occurs , he will prove his assertions true . s2 claims that the origin of aids in the united states is unknown and that the spread of aids was caused by unclean needles , unprotected sex , and contaminated blood transfusions . he rejects the requirement that he should provide proof for his claims by citing __s1__ 's failure to do so . he suggests that once __s1__ begins to debate appropriately , then he will too .

Article ->  so , then 2 gays people living together in va should n't expect healthcare , since a couple who is n't married does n't get it . '' thats just the way it is '' is n't much of an argument ! so , basically __s1__ do n't care that some people can have rights , while others who should have them do n't get them . so , s2 take it __s1__ liked segregation , __prohabition__ and prefer women barefoot in the kitchen rather than at the polls voting for anything . wow ! all s2 an say is wow . __s1__ is guessing s2 mean '' prohibition '' . gays do n't have the right to shared healthcare because they are not married ! gays have rights ... they can marry members of the opposite sex . nobody can marry members of the opposite sex , it 's not just gays . gays have all the rights that straight people do . __straights__ ca n't marry people of the same sex , and neither can gays . if __straigh__ people want __heatlcare__ , they can marry someone of the opposite sex ... so can gays ! we do n't have the right to marry who we love and if ya did n't notice it is n't someone of the same sex . what a __ridculous__ posts ! we are fighting to the right to marry , we will win , we will have healthcare and we are in __s1__ 's neighborhood too ! trust me , we are nor backing down to the __xtian__ right wing . we shall overcome ! haha !! it seems like '' s2 all '' are going in the wrong direction then . thousands of gays in san francisco recently had their marriages __enulled__ . a judge in seattle was also told he ca n't allow gays to get married . missouri just voted to outlaw gay marriage -lrb- 70 % of the people voted to ban it ... pretty alarming if s2 ask me -rrb- . how do s2 figure s2 are in the process to '' overcome '' ? it looks quite the opposite if s2 ask me . the only luck s2 have is moving to another country or moving to massachusetts . mark __s1__ 's word , there will never be a federal law allowing gay marriages in the us . that 's just what they said about slavery , women voting , __interacial__ marriage . it is what they said about people flying , looking for a cure to polio , it is always darkest before the dawn ! looking at slavery is incorrect . slavery was wrong because certain individuals who could n't change their color were targeted and often tortured . they were treated as property and had no rights . however , gays have the exact same rights as __heterosexuals__ and are not property , nor can they be targeted by color , etc. . women voting is also a terrible example . that has to do with free speech , which is an __unalienable__ right -lrb- last time __s1__ checked , gays being allowed to marry was n't an __unalienable__ right -rrb- . that was also when women could n't hold jobs and had to work in the home . gays do n't have to do that . interracial marriage goes along with slavery and is an absolutely terrible example . it was looked down upon , not illegal . thomas jefferson had children by a black woman .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that homosexual partners should n't expect shared healthcare in the same way that an unmarried couple should n't . he suggests that homosexuals are not being denied any rights , that they have all the same rights as !!__heterosexuals__!! . he points out that nobody can marry someone of the same sex , not just homosexuals . he rejects the idea that homosexuals will succeed in legalizing same-sex marriage , citing several cases where homosexual marriages were banned . s2 accuses __s1__ of accepting that some people should not receive the basic right to marry the person they love . he likens this to slavery , prohibition , and women 's suffrage . he claims that the proponents of same-sex marriage will eventually be successful , just as human rights advocates were with slavery , voting , and interracial marriage .

Article ->  sorry , but people have certain natural rights -- keeping people from being religious infringes on that . __s1__ is not saying businesses ca n't legally do it -- they can -- __s1__ is saying __s1__ think it 's pretty unethical . it 's easy for __s1__ to sit back and say what __s1__ are saying when __s1__ dislike religion , but this is no different than an employer telling a gay employee they ca n't express themselves as being gay on the job . one is discrimination for being gay , the other is discrimination for being religious . if __s1__ are going to be for equality , then be for equality in all cases . not just picking and choosing __s1__ 's pet issues . once again __jyoshu__ ; s2 manage a fast food __resturant__ . do __s1__ agree that s2 do not have to serve boy scouts and evangelical __christains__ ? s2 's moral beliefs are against them s2 should have the right to turn away their business . after all they go against s2 's religious beliefs so s2 can refuse to serve , or even hire them . right ? if s2 use __s1__ 's logic s2 should __beable__ to do whatever s2 want and use s2 's religious beliefs as an excuse . mistaken notion ? she said clearly '' __s1__ have worked on plenty of legislation ... we enact the will of the people '' it sounds to me like she 's a legislator . that 's certainly the way it comes across -- how could s2 possibly take that any other way ? a better analogy would be if s2 were trying to force a jewish employee , whom s2 knew was jewish , to work on his sabbath rather than being willing to work with him about that . or to suddenly tell him he has to eat a pork sandwich or something . and remember , this is a different issue than __benignly__ serving food . we are talking about a major religious issue here -- gay marriage , to religious people , is like asking them to approve most any bad thing in society s2 can think of . s2 have to take the seriousness of the religious view into account here somewhat . why ? it is not s2 's problem they have evil religious values . do they work for the state or god ? does god pay their paychecks or do the taxpayers ? they just have to sign a civil contract . so what if that person is the only person able to do marriage contracts in the area . how does the state ensure that gay people can __exersize__ their right to marriage if the only person able to perform the marriage is exempted from __perfoming__ the marriage based upon religious beliefs ? __s1__ just think s2 are viewing this the wrong way -- making it more complicated than it is . it is simply a provision that allows a person to let someone else conduct the civil ceremony if their religious beliefs do n't allow them to do it . the same idea that would allow a jewish person to pass on eating pork if it were suddenly expected for him or her to do it when it was n't before . that 's all this is -- let 's not make mountains out of __molehills__ ... yet what if there is no one else in the community ? how is the government going to ensure gay people are able to __exersize__ their rights ? well , then __s1__ guess they need to ensure someone is there that will do it as well . gee , that darn religious freedom -- messing everything up , huh ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing a seemingly pending law that would permit marriage officials to decline to conduct gay marriages if they are opposed to them on religious principals . __s1__ finds it acceptable , while s2 complains about it . __s1__ proposes that it is easy for s2 to be unsympathetic because s2 dislikes religion . __s1__ acknowledges that he considers such religious objections to be evil . he suggests that because the individual licensed to perform a marriage is paid or licensed by the state , the individual should reflect the will and choices of the state and therefore perform gay marriages despite his or her personal religious objection to them . s2 suspects that the law may result in an effective denial of gay marriage .
generated -> s1 is not saying businesses ca n't legally do it to sit back and say what s1 are saying when s1 dislike religion , but this is no different than an employer telling a gay employee they ca n't legally do it . if s1 are going to be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality in all cases that

Article ->  who are __s1__ to say it is unjust ? who are 5 people to say a law is unjust ? we have a system that says the most votes for something wins . . we are the ones being oppressed by the majority that is who we are . it is our lives that are on the ballot and our rights that our being denied that is who we are . we are the ones who are being told we are second __calss__ citizens . we are the ones who are being told are families are not families . we are the ones who are told we are less then dirt . of course being a heterosexual __s1__ would not understand . __s1__ suggest s2 get a majority of people and change the law then . this is what happened during slavery ... they actually passed 3 amendments about it . the courts are n't the all knowing group of people that have enlightened minds about what is or is n't fair . s2 's whole case is based on saying the majority is always be ignored if someone objects to them . __s1__ am in the minority when it comes to abortion ... does this mean the court should listen to me and declare abortion illegal ? no because abortion does not effect __s1__ 's life personally . that __iis__ __waht__ we mean the courts should look at the __individuials__ life and decide upon that . if a law that the majority favors is unjust in an __individuials__ life then it must be over ruled for the __individuials__ sake . what ? that makes no sense . if a law is unjust to one person then it needs to be overruled ? of course __unjustice__ is defined by the person in question . s2 make no sense here . s2 still fail to understand how our courts work too . s2 want them to work a certain way as opposed to the way they were created under our constitution . __s1__ want a society that __oppresses__ people . if the law effects even one person __adversly__ then it is unjust and needs to be overturned . it only goes to prove that conservatives are heartless and want people to suffer . __s1__ want a society that is free to make laws and rules as it sees fit . __s1__ guess we __oppress__ child __molesters__ but __s1__ am ok with that .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ , a heterosexual , and s2 , a homosexual , discuss the !!__justness__!! of the legislative process , majority rule , and how the latter affects individuals and the gay community . s2 describes how the gay community is discriminated against , and !!__posits__!! that because laws regarding homosexuals impact them more directly than the general population , it is unfair to have a majority rule apply . __s1__ accuses s2 of not understanding the legal system and proposes that s2 find majority to have legislation passed , and not look to the courts to redress the discrimination . __s1__ !!__analogizes__!! that process to how slavery was abolished , and also !!__analogizes__!! the alleged oppression to the oppression that may be felt by anti-abortion advocates and child !!__molesters__!! as a result of majority rule .
generated -> unjust ? we are the ones who are being told are families are not families . s1 suggest s2 get a majority of people and change the law then . if a law is unjust to one person then it needs to be overruled ? no because abortion does not effect s1 's life personally that

Article ->  __s1__ wish . but however much __s1__ disagree with sullivan on many political issues , he 's right about that . the world did change when the mass. legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights . it may be a big change in a small state , but it is a recognition that the winds of change are blowing against homophobic bigotry . __s1__ are just going to have to get over it . the world just is n't as anti-gay as it used to be . and that means that __s1__ are going to have to accept equal rights eventually , as gay marriage . presumably __s1__ will hope than in a few years , bigots in massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality . __s1__ think you 'll be out of luck . __s1__ wish that s2 wish . do __s1__ just like to argue for the sake of being argumentative ? __s1__ have picked out the one single thing s2 said there that __s1__ could disagree with and are making an issue of it , not even willing to agree on anything else s2 said . but fine , go ahead and think this is some __world-changing__ event if it makes __s1__ feel better . well , clearly __s1__ did n't even read s2 's post . -lrb- shrug -rrb- s2 have often posted here that s2 oppose gay marriage . that means s2 oppose equal rights for gays . if s2 have changed s2 's mind , and hope that massachusetts does n't overturn gay marriage , s2 would have said so . since s2 did n't , s2 do n't . no , __s1__ said __s1__ s2 '' will hope than in a few years , bigots in massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality '' . s2 had said , very plainly , that s2 think such legislation is an __over-intrusion__ by the government . clearly __s1__ did n't read s2 's post . are s2 claiming now s2 are in favour of legal marriage for gays in massachusetts now the legislature has voted for it ? because if so , that would be a change . s2 is saying that s2 would not want an amendment put in place banning it , because that would be an __over-intrusion__ into peoples ' lives by the government . so naturally , s2 would n't want such an amendment voted into creation , either , and that 's why s2 took issue with __s1__ 's claim that s2 would . that 's been s2 's position here for as long as s2 remember . and it 's a true conservative position -lrb- as opposed to __neocon__ -rrb- , __btw__ . are s2 saying that s2 are not in favour of a government ban on gay marriage ? s2 oppose doma laws ? does that mean s2 are now , contrary to s2 's previous posts , in favour of legal recognition of gay marriage ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing a legislative action associated with a massachusetts court ruling which is favorable to gay rights . __s1__ is enthusiastic about the matter and sees it as a step in the right direction against bigotry , and a recognition that the world is not as anti-gay as it used to be , which s2 is advised to acknowledge and accept . __s1__ also accuses s2 of being inconsistent in having been on the record on the website opposing gay marriage -lrb- and !!__therefor__!! according to __s1__ being opposed to equal rights for gays -rrb- , but now also taking a position that the state should not intervene to ban gay marriage . s2 defends that position and argues it is based on conservative principles against intrusions into individual lives .
generated -> the world did change when the mass. legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights . it may be a big change in a small state , but it may be a big change in a small state , but it is a recognition that the winds of change are blowing against homophobic bigotry .

Article ->  certainly not yours . s2 should know that __s1__ am for no marriage in government . it should be left to a religious institution where it will actually mean something . the states should then go back to doing something that actually makes sense and does n't reward people like britney spears for being white trash . that is all well and good , but it is not the religious ceremony and sanction that gays are looking for . they already have that ; there are churches that perform same-sex marriages . it is the civil benefits that are at issue . are __s1__ saying __s1__ would be in favor of __foregoing__ all the legal rights and benefits __s1__ are afforded by marriage ? for example * assumption of spouse s pension * automatic inheritance * automatic housing lease transfer * bereavement leave * burial determination * child custody * crime victim s recovery benefits * divorce protections * domestic violence protection * exemption from property tax on partner s death * immunity from testifying against spouse * insurance breaks * joint adoption and foster care * joint bankruptcy * joint parenting -lrb- insurance coverage , school records -rrb- * medical decisions on behalf of partner * certain property rights * reduced rate memberships * sick leave to care for partner * visitation of partner s children * visitation of partner in hospital or prison * wrongful death -lrb- loss of consort -rrb- benefits what do s2 say ? yeah __s1__ know . __s1__ is saying that there should be a better system . for example , if had a best friend who are roommates with ... both __hetero__ for the sake of argument ... and never wish to get married then could they get some of the benefits described ? __s1__ 's uncle actually was single until he died but he had a female friend who he was best friends with ... why could n't they get some kind of benefits if they so choose ? hospital __vistiation__ rights and things of that nature are obviously the most important in this kinda situation . it just seems the single folks are the ones getting screwed over in the marriage deal but gay folks are not ? to the single folks , s2 say get married . ok , lets use that logic ... . to the gay folks __s1__ say marry a woman . bet s2 are n't happy with that if want the benefits of marriage , get married . but ought to be able to marry a person of 's choice . 's suggestion would be to marry someone s2 do n't want to me married to , that is a different thing . it is not using '' that logic '' . s2 thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you . is n't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities ? s2 am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly . s2 happen to think that 's a bad idea . people get married for many reasons , some of which s2 would feel are not good reasons , but s2 would not make it illegal to do so . s2 am talking about the right to marry a person of 's choosing .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 discuss the civil benefits of marriage and how they could or could not be extended to single people and gay people . __s1__ is initially against government being involved in the equation , but after s2 describes many of the legal rights and benefits associated with marriage , such as automatic inheritance and hospital visitation rights , __s1__ is then able to relate to the issues by considering the case of his life-long bachelor uncle , suggesting that it is single people who are discriminated against by being excluded from the marriage benefits . s2 suggests that if a single person desires the benefits of marriage , they should marry , but that they should be able to marry a person of either gender as they see fit .
generated -> s2 should know that s1 am for no marriage in government . the states should then go back to doing something that actually makes sense and does n't reward people like britney spears for being white trash . it is the civil benefits that are at issue .

Article ->  it seems to me that the point there is that it is not a bigot ... er , spade merely because __s1__ call it a spade . __imo__ , if someone has to resort to name-calling , it tends to only indicate they are having to resort to something besides sound arguments . oh my . perhaps we should say it 's an anti-gay bias , or a person with an __anit-gay__ bias ? are the terms __acceptance-challenged__ , __inclusion-challenged__ , anti-discrimination challenged , appealing to you ? e __mutz__ or his '' joe '' , assumed those protesting against gay discrimination are nuts or trying to hijack heritage , but wo n't say why . if it walks like a duck and __quacks__ like a duck , chances are ... or maybe he 's simply arguing a different point than you . __imo__ it 's just simply arrogant of s2 to automatically write off disagreement as '' bigotry '' . your view is that this is about '' acceptance '' ; but that does n't mean that 's the real issue . e __mutz__ is right in saying that disagreement is not the same as bigotry . what is the basis for the disagreement or the different point of view if it is not a lack of acceptance of homosexuality or its visible and open displays and representations ? but the problem is that s2 insist on always __mischaracterizing__ that as bigotry . it 's a very ugly word , and __s1__ suspect that 's the reason s2 use it -lrb- for its effect -rrb- and why s2 do n't entertain the idea that bigotry may not always be what 's behind it . s2 say it is , and s2 explain why . replace the word '' gay '' with another minority , and tell me it is not . it 's an ugly thing . s2 have explained why s2 believe that 's what 's behind it . if __s1__ believe do n't believe that , why do n't __s1__ tell me what is behind it ? __s1__ think it all goes back to one 's motivations . what __s1__ do n't think s2 and some others understand is that people often do n't take that stand on the basis of not liking gay people . they do it because of the way they view marriage . if any other minority came along wanting marriage to be changed from one man and one woman , __s1__ suspect they had get the same response . we were n't just discussing marriage specifically . somehow whenever gays are involved , a group of people take a stand of being opposed , because of the way they view one thing or another in society , as being __straight-only__ , or excluding gays . yes , from the anti-gay crowd , sorry those who do n't wish to include gays . however , no other identified minority would want that , because only one minority identifies as gay . but it 's not always about __not-including-gays__ . that 's not the basis in many cases . -lrb- hey , that rhymes ! -rrb- it 's about the way they view marriage ! they had be that way toward any group wanting to change marriage to fit themselves if it changed marriage from the traditional view . __s1__ assure s2 if there was a movement afoot in this country by __polygamists__ to change marriage to include them , there would be a similar reaction toward that . it 's not that s2 are gay . it 's that s2 want to redefine marriage . ah , there 's no use . __s1__ have tried to get s2 to see this before .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that it is inappropriate to label disagreement as bigotry , and that while someone might think an argument is bigoted , it may be motivated by something other than bigotry . he argues that many people 's opinions are based on their view of marriage , not their dislike of homosexuals , and that they would be against any group wanting to alter the traditional view of marriage . s2 claims that opponents of gay rights are discriminatory and bigoted . he suggests that if you replaced gays with another minority , then the arguments against them would appear negative -lrb- e. g. , trying to exclude any other minority from getting married would not be acceptable -rrb- . he believes that opponents of gay marriage are not protecting traditional marriage , but are discriminating against homosexuals .

Article ->  yet s2 still will not answer the question . how does equal marriage hurt her or any heterosexual ? if she has her way __s1__ am the one that is hurt . __s1__ 's way of equal marriage __s1__ am not hurt nor is she . yes s2 did , in this post . s2 __summarize__ so what if a proposed law '' hurts '' you ? there are all kinds of laws that '' hurt '' all kinds of people . but is glad to see that s2 abandoned s2 's silly argument that it would be a violation of the first amendment to enact her religious belief about marriage , but not a violation of the first amendment to enact your religious belief about marriage . now , if s2 could only justify why only laws which do not cause '' harm '' to others are allowed to be enacted . frankly am astounded by s2 's affinity for the '' harm principle '' when s2 say things like '' do n't know about the '' culture war '' but am at war with evangelical anti gay christianity . will do whatever it takes to knock then down . '' because __s1__ am only concerned with rights of gay people . gay people are __s1__ 's first concern . this evil woman should come out and __sayshe__ is anti gay . she should come out and say she does n't want gay people to get married . she should admit that she wants gay people to remain second class citizens . why does n't she own up to her discrimination ? she wants to protect her heterosexual __privledge__ . for the record __s1__ own that statement and stand behind it . __s1__ will talk people out of attending these bible churches . __s1__ will do what __s1__ can to legally disrupt any __rundrasining__ activities they have going . __s1__ will protest their wedding ceremonies . __s1__ will protest their church services . as far as __s1__ am concerned , once they crossed over the line and started pushing for and getting laws enacted that hurt me , __s1__ 's family , __ands__ __s1__ 's people , they have no place in society . and __s1__ have yet to show why this is not a legitimate viewpoint , nor a legitimate way to legislate this issue . it 's obvious that all __s1__ care about is gay people . however , __s1__ have not shown why anti-gay -lrb- as __s1__ call them -rrb- people should not be able to legislate their view . all __s1__ have said is that __s1__ do n't like their view . big deal , they do n't like __s1__ 's view either . thus , in a democracy like ours , the majority of people decide issues like this . besides that , s2 think coming out in support of a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage qualifies as '' com -lsb- ing -rsb- out and say -lsb- ing -rsb- that she does n't want gay people to get married . '' this is fine . but also understand that it is legitimate for people who believe like ms. __musgrave__ to do the same , including to use the democratic process to have her view enacted in law . if __s1__ are free to do it , then she is as well . should the majority have the right to __enslave__ their fellow citizens ? should the majority have the right to lock people up in concentration camps ? a majority of the people in the us once thought it was a good idea . oh __s1__ want the evil woman to say it . __s1__ want her __viciousness__ and ugliness out in the open . if she is anti gay then she needs to own up to her bigotry repent america believes in protesting and disrupting gay gatherings . why if they can do this __s1__ can do the same . the majority did have the legal right -lrb- unfortunately -rrb- to __enslave__ their fellow citizens until the 13 th amendment took that option off the table . incidentally , it took a majority of people to take slavery off of the table . in the united states , the majority wins -lrb- for good or for ill -rrb- . s2 hope __s1__ are not trying to make a comparison between the denial of marriage to gays -lrb- and to 10 year olds , and to those who are currently married yet want another husband / wife , and to those who wish to marry their father , etc. -rrb- on the one hand , and slavery and / or concentration camps on the other . ok , and what would that accomplish ? yeah , that 's exactly what s2 said .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are talking about how democracy is based on majority rule and whether or not its fair . __s1__ believes it is completely unfair that gay marriage be dismissed or disliked and s2 argues that no matter what __s1__ believes is right or wrong , the majority of people control what is normal in our society . that if __s1__ is only towards the rights of gay people it is completely understandable for this lady to be in belief that marriage as is is fine . s2 believes that __s1__ 's argument is not a legitimate viewpoint because __s1__ has no justification that this lady hates gays . __s1__ believes that because this lady is not in favor of gay marriage , the lady is anti-gay . __s1__ is taking an aggressive approach by saying they will talk to bible churches and disrupt them because she feels like she has no place in society . __s1__ thinks that the majority of people is !!__enslaving__!! their people by not allowing gay rights , but s2 argues that it happens that way and it changes over time .
generated -> equal marriage hurt her or any heterosexual ? if she has her way s1 am the one that is hurt her or any heterosexual ? if a proposed law '' hurts '' you ? there are all kinds of laws that it would be a violation of the first amendment to enact her religious belief about marriage , but not a violation of the first amendment to enact her religious belief about marriage .

Article ->  agreed she is ignoring __s1__ 's religious freedom and trying to institute her religion into law . the law that will bar __s1__ 's family from legal protections . it wo n't protect her marriage but will bar me and __s1__ 's people from from being full citizens . she is n't protecting marriage but __perserving__ her heterosexual __privledge__ . how on earth is she impeding on __s1__ religious freedom ? she is n't trying to take away __s1__ 's right to any religious ceremony . with such a wide-open standard of what constitutes religious freedom that __s1__ seem to have , any legislation could be construed as imposing on religious freedom . because it is her religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman . __s1__ 's religious belief is that marriage is between two people that love each other regardless of sex . she is tying to place her religious __belif__ into law over mine . who gets hurt here ? if __s1__ 's religious belief is put into law she can still marry the person of her choice . if her religious belief gets put into law she can still marry the person of her choice but __s1__ do not get to . so __s1__ and __s1__ 's people are hurt by __codifing__ her religious belief into law . she is trying to keep gay people out of marriage and thus preserve her heterosexual __privledge__ . but by that definition , either one could be viewed as impeding on religious freedom , including __s1__ 's view impeding on hers ! we do n't define imposing on religious freedom on the basis of having different ideals . it does n't effect __s1__ 's religion or religious freedom if __s1__ do n't get benefits under gay marriages . __s1__ can argue in other ways , on other basis , but the idea that not giving gays marriage benefits is imposing on religious freedom is an empty '' argument '' . but s2 have not shown how she would be harmed by equal marriage ? __s1__ have shown that her definition infringes upon __s1__ 's religious freedom . if gay marriage becomes a reality then in no way does it infringe upon her in any way . would s2 care to explain how gay marriage infringes upon her in any way ? it is her heterosexual __privledge__ and her __sence__ of entitlement that she is protecting not marriage . __s1__ may -lrb- or may not -rrb- can show harm in another sense , but __s1__ certainly have not shown how __s1__ 's religious rights are taken away or harmed , to begin with . that 's the point . __s1__ certainly have not shown how her definition infringes upon __s1__ 's religious freedom -- __s1__ are still free to be just as religious in practice and belief as ever if __musgrave__ 's views became law . __s1__ are trying to use a religious freedom argument here and it just does n't fit . yes __s1__ have . have n't s2 been __poaying__ attention ? -rsb- because it is her religious belief that marriage is between a man and a woman . __s1__ 's religious belief is that marriage is between two people that love each other regardless of sex . she is tying to place her religious __belif__ into law over mine . who gets hurt here ? if __s1__ 's religious belief is put into law she can still marry the person of her choice . if her religious belief gets put into law she can still marry the person of her choice but __s1__ do not get to . so __s1__ and __s1__ 's people are hurt by __codifing__ her religious belief into law . she is trying to keep gay people out of marriage and thus preserve her heterosexual __privledge__ . ok ! s2 's religious belief says that it 's important to smoke in public __non-smoking__ areas . s2 's religious belief says that it 's important to drive cars as fast as one can on city streets . s2 's religious belief says that the death penalty should never be enforced . gee , this it fun , using religion as an excuse and means to an end to fight legislation ! too bad for __s1__ it does n't work that way . what __s1__ do n't get is that , by __s1__ 's standard , either would be placing one religion over another . the same justification could be made against __s1__ 's view because __s1__ 's view goes against my religious belief . and then if __s1__ say '' but __s1__ 's view causes harm and mine does n't '' then it 's no longer a religious issue so the point is moot to begin with . you missed the point here she is trying to turn her religious belief into law that bars me from from getting married . how is she hurt if it is __s1__ 's religious belief of equal marriage is turned into law ? __s1__ have no idea whether or not she is truly trying to turn her religious belief into law . she may just happen to believe that way religiously , but be pushing for the law because she thinks that 's best for __socety__ . __iow__ , __s1__ have no idea if religion is her real motivation for the law . there 's no way to know or to police someone 's real motivations . __s1__ am part of society and her belief is not in __s1__ 's best __intrest__ . how does __s1__ 's being able to marry a man hurt her in any way ?
ref_sum ->  this is about gay marriage . __s1__ seems to believe that someone is making religion into law by saying marriage should be between a heterosexual couple . s2 is arguing that __s1__ 's point is not very valid because __s1__ is not understanding that they are not using the persons perspective . __s1__ believes that that person is trying to hurt them , while s2 is saying that the person may not necessarily be that way and that the person may be arguing for what they believe to be greater for society , based on their own perspective . __s1__ 's religious view of marriage is based on two people 's love for each other , while the other person believes its between a man and woman . s2 says __s1__ 's argument is empty and that __s1__ is not showing how the other person is being hurt by gay marriage . s2 thinks __s1__ is not understanding the overall perspectives and just focusing on their own needs . __s1__ states that the person 's religion put into law affects peoples ability to marry if they are gay , but that __s1__ 's religion on marriage put into law would not affect marriage for anyone .
generated -> the law that will bar s1 's family from legal protections . it wo n't protect her marriage but will bar me and s1 's people from being full citizens . she is trying to keep gay people out of marriage and thus preserve her heterosexual privledge that

Article ->  __lesz__ , __s1__ 's marriage means a great many things to me , none of which have anything to do with our governments . __s1__ 's question to s2 is what do __s1__ think marriage should mean to our governments ? well , marriage is an ancient human institution , based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans , and is one of the foundations of social stability . why would it surprise anyone that government might wish to support it ? what really surprises me is to find how many alleged christians now find it __expedient__ to demand government '' get out of marriage '' , simply because gay people want to get in it . bunch of hypocrites -- they never complained about government regulating marriage before this . now , while s2 agree it is n't absolutely essential for government to be involved in the regulation and support of marriage , it is nevertheless a convenience that few people would really want to throw away . -lrb- mr. __writela__ has summed it up eloquently so s2 need n't elaborate . -rrb- alas , many are just too mean-spirited to share marriage with those pesky __homos__ , so they have jumped on the __get-out-of-marriage__ bandwagon -- which is n't going to go anywhere -- as camouflage for their real feelings . that government would wish to be involved in any aspect of our lives , would not surprise me . that is what governments tend to do . consider the '' healthy marriage initiative '' . this is our government and as citizens , we would be well advised to exercise vigilance to prevent our government from __intruding__ into areas where there is no necessity . just because a few mean-spirited hypocrites may advocate that the government get out of marriage for the wrong reasons does not mean that the idea is all bad . never happen ? enlist the 100 single people who have the biggest stake in this issue and chip away at the exclusive benefits . start with an easy one like hospital visitation and work up to the tough ones like social security to spouses why ? why is it in the interests of society to prevent government involvement in marriage ? that 's what __s1__ have n't explained . __mrwritela__ pointed out the reasons that government involvement is pretty much unavoidable , if only because government is the source of law . it seems to me __s1__ advocate the replacement of marriage with a plethora of minor and specific legal contracts that would only benefit the lawyers writing them . it 's the wood and the trees . if specific laws are trees , then marriage is the forest that protects our relationships from such gales that xxxx . is there any specific advantage to looking to individual trees and ignoring the wood ? __lesz__ __s1__ ask why and s2 ask why not . why should government get out of the marriage business 1 . it is not needed 2 . the current marriage benefits are terribly unfair to single people that are forced to pay for them . __s1__ 's __eloquence__ notwithstanding , have found it useful to look very closely at the trees when solving problems . would suggest that one can not understand the wood unless one knows something about trees . also , have often found it useful to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller parts and solving the easiest parts first . why is government support of marriage unfair to single people ? single people do not have the same issues as married people . having been married and single myself , s2 do have some insight here . and why would rather married people go to lawyers for multiple legal contracts to cover all the hundreds of rights and mutual obligations currently conferred by marriage ? are a lawyer in need of clients ? __;-rrb-__ s2 's own experience of woods and trees is that there is no value in looking at them in only one way . one needs to consider them as trees and woods . __s1__ have also been single and married . experience but not much insight . __s1__ would be interested to hear s2 's views about this difference in issues and how these issues are helped by government involvement . __lesz__ , __s1__ am an engineer , not a lawyer . well , single people live by themselves , not as a family . by definition , they do not have a significant relationship -- and no , s2 do n't count boyfriends or girlfriends here , s2 am referring to committed couples who live together as a family unit . there are many legal issues such as inheritance , pension and social security rights , adoption and child custody , home ownership , etc. , which would need separate legal contracts without the umbrella of marriage . -lrb- and of course , even then such contracts would only be enforceable by government . -rrb- s2 myself had tremendous difficulties sorting out property issues with s2 's partner 's family after he died . it all but __bankrupted__ me , and there would n't have been any issue at all had it been legal for us to get married . we did have some legal contracts pertaining to the house , and wills , but alas they were n't good enough to get his family off s2 's back , because our legal relationship was trumped by his familial one . s2 am not saying it could n't be done piecemeal , tailor-made to suit each individual couple , but would n't that be excessively inconvenient -- for everyone but the lawyers ? whereas at __prresent__ , when __s1__ get married for a $ 25 license , hey presto , __s1__ get those protections and the lawyers have to defer their caribbean cruise .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are debating the topic of what marriage should mean to our government . __s1__ believes it is not a bad idea because they think it is not necessary for the government to be involved in most aspects of our lives , while s2 is questioning why it 's necessary to try and remove government involvement when it is unavoidable . __s1__ brings up that because several people are against the government due to gay marriage and not because it 's just marriage altogether , it does n't mean it 's not a bad idea to remove government intervention . __s1__ mentions the `` healthy marriage initiative '' and how it is n't necessary . s2 says that there is too much legal work and documents behind marriage in the government , such as inheritance , pension and social rights , etc. . , and that it would be a lot more work if the government did n't intervene , also stating that removing marriage from government will only benefit lawyers . both __s1__ and s2 have had experience with marriage , s2 states that marriage benefits are good because of government intervention .
generated -> marriage '' an ancient human institution , based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans , and is one of the foundations of social stability that alas , many are just too mean-spirited to share marriage with those pesky homos , so they have jumped on the get-out-of-marriage bandwagon . why is it in the interests of society to prevent government involvement in marriage ? that

Article ->  in the sense that saying one supports gay rights but not gay marriage , sure . but __s1__ have no problem with that inconsistency . however , s2 are for gay marriage , __ergo__ , it makes more sense s2 had be bothered by that inconsistency . but if not , fine . whatever ... -lrb- and yes , __s1__ know s2 have given me s2 's ' reasons ' . does n't mean there 's no inconsistency there . it just means s2 think it 's not something that should be challenged right now . -rrb- again , s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't understand why __s1__ keep saying it 's an '' inconsistency '' . it 's not a matter of it being a '' problem '' , but rather a question of why __s1__ repeatedly label it as an '' inconsistency '' . just to try to put this plainly . __s1__ and biden have both stated the same opinion . against gay marriage , but for gay rights in every other way . with __s1__ 's stated opinion statement , s2 do n't see an inconsistency . but __s1__ do see an inconsistency with __s1__ 's stated opinion statement . quite frankly , s2 really have n't seen __s1__ show an inconsistency yet . __s1__ have said '' inconsistency '' , but not show it . it 's a bit like saying '' frank is inconsistent on the abortion issue '' , but that 's it . it would be showing an inconsistency to show frank 's statement saying '' s2 am against all abortion '' , but then he has no problem with his wife getting an abortion cause she does n't want to lose her figure . nothing in his statement is '' inconsistent '' , __imo__ . if __s1__ say biden is '' inconsistent '' , __s1__ are also saying that about __s1__ 's position ... s2 know , if s2 are n't able to grasp the concept of the inconsistency of saying one is against gay marriage when saying they are for gay rights , __s1__ do n't know what else to say . it would be different if s2 did n't think gay marriage should be a right . but s2 do , so how could his position not be inconsistent to you ? to take s2 's abortion example , it would be like someone saying they are for reproductive / abortion rights , but yet being against it being legal for women to get an abortion at an abortion clinic . frankly , s2 are grasping at straws at this point . but that 's your position ... if __s1__ ca n't grasp that __s1__ are saying your own position is inconsistent , s2 do n't know what to say . yeah . __s1__ have no recollection of what s2 's position actually is , do you . as s2 have already explained to you , s2 see that a person can be for gay rights and against gay marriage . s2 see that a person can propose a compromise , that s2 personally would find acceptable . s2 ca n't tell __s1__ how many people have posted '' s2 do n't believe gay marriage is a right '' . if they also say '' s2 believe gays should have equal rights '' , there is no contradiction just cause s2 believe -lrb- let me repeat that , s2 believe -rrb- that gay marriage is a right . s2 think biden 's wrong . but his view is consistent . on another note , s2 am just amazed that __s1__ think __s1__ 's own position is inconsistent . s2 honestly had no idea ... are s2 just not reading the thread __????__ apparently not . let me repeat myself ... '' in the sense that saying one supports gay rights but not gay marriage , sure . '' __s1__ have already said __s1__ know it 's inconsistent , but that __s1__ do n't care . it 's not a pet issue for me . it is for you . yet s2 are far more concerned , it seems , about the inconsistency on __s1__ 's part than on biden 's part . yet it 's biden who 's s2 's candidate . stop the dishonesty of pretending __s1__ have n't already addressed that . actually , s2 did n't think __s1__ had recognized what __s1__ had admitted . next sentence __s1__ talked about biden ... '' more concerned '' ? s2 am arguing against the general position . it does n't matter who holds it . one of the points with biden , as explained in multiple points before , is how the perception of holding his feet to the fire could impact others ... if s2 could have a private one-on-one with biden , or if he logged on anonymously to this __web-site__ , s2 would discuss it with him just the same . quite frankly , the '' he 's our candidate '' thing is one of the things that takes precedent . see , we do n't approach these things as '' single issue '' type guys . we weigh the '' gay marriage opinion '' up against the impact of pushing him hard on it a few weeks away from election day , and balance the responding approach accordingly . s2 hear somewhere that '' single issue '' guys can be frowned upon . that ai n't us ...
ref_sum ->  it seems like they are discussing the inconsistency of each other 's arguments . __s1__ is getting annoyed and seems to just be arguing because they are `` venting '' while s2 is saying that the inconsistency is present and making all arguments invalid without proof . both __s1__ and s2 are for gay rights , s2 is stating that __s1__ is n't being consistent and `` admits '' to being inconsistent , while __s1__ is saying they do n't care about the inconsistency because of the point they are trying to get across . they bring up biden and abortion in ways that dont exactly fit the discussion , but just to show the inconsistency in each others opinions . s2 is saying they would handle this same situation with biden the exact same way because s2 is simply talking about perspective . __s1__ believes s2 is stating that __s1__ believes in gay marriage but not gay rights , which seems contradictory to __s1__ 's point . this argument does not have a set topic .
generated -> again , s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't mean there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency .

Article ->  because it 's all quite clear . decades of effort from the religious right , conservative republicans , and their like have made gay rights a poisoned topic . it 's a tragedy , but saying the right thing on this issue will cost s2 more votes than it will gain you , everyone knows it , and no one is going to do it . it 's politics 101 . the democrats , as a whole , want to do the right thing , but they know that if they say so too loudly they wo n't be in a position to do anything . they are forced to moderate their public stances so that they can get into positions where they can actually take action . this is of course a __generalization__ , but if s2 are talking about a political party as a whole that 's unavoidable . so , __s1__ are basically saying that biden was lying through his teeth when he said he does n't support gay marriage ? it was all just a lie to keep from losing votes ? interesting . possibly , __s1__ could n't say . certainly as a democrat he gets more benefit of the doubt than __s1__ would give a republican when it comes to gay rights , but __s1__ have n't __plumbed__ his record enough to say for sure . and let 's be honest here , s2 do not find the idea that a politician might be lying interesting . what s2 had prefer is that the candidates be honest about their views , whether it 's popular or unpopular . but even knowing we are talking about political candidates -lrb- who may lie to get votes -rrb- , when a candidate says something is his or her view , s2 think we have to take them at what they say when they answer a question like that so directly and emphatically . otherwise , there 's little point in asking questions to begin with other than maybe watching the reaction of body language and how they would respond under pressure , and so forth . political discourse has to operate to where when a candidate gives a given view as his or her view , they are taken at their word that is their view . '' no '' ca n't mean '' yes '' and so forth . no , that 's too __niave__ an approach . we know politicians are going to tell some lies , __s1__ trust that 's a given . we , as political consumers , ca n't simply take politicians at their word . if we want to make informed decisions about candidates we need to develop the skills to make useful judgement calls about what they are saying . we need to figure out how often they lie , what they lie about , how big their lies are . obviously we should n't need to do this , it would be great if we could actually take our politicians at their word . bad the sad reality is that we ca n't , not at this stage anyway . in this particular case , if biden says he does n't support gay marriage __s1__ is just as likely to think it 's because he knows that open support could cost him the white house as any other reason . it 's sad that such double speak is needed , __s1__ had love it if enough courageous politicians stood forth and ended the political need for lies , but until that wonderful day __s1__ is not going to be naive and take everything they say at their word , nor am __s1__ going to jump up and down and point fingers at every __falsehood__ . i 'll try to judge the politicians by their actions , and their lies by their magnitude , scope , and quantity . s2 think __s1__ are misunderstanding me -- s2 do n't mean s2 think we should assume they are going to always tell the truth -- s2 mean we should put the expectation on them to be honest . __iow__ , honesty is what we should demand . if we are n't even going to do that , there 's no point in ever asking a political candidate a direct question . knowing they are going to lie is n't the same as having the expectation on them to be honest . s2 really do n't think it 's too much to ask our candidates to say what their views are . __s1__ just said yourself '' we need to figure out how often they lie , what they lie about , how big their lies are '' so , obviously , __s1__ believe it 's not really good that they are lying . there would be little point in asking them questions if we are n't going to hold to them to some level of expectation that they are going to say what they mean . sure , they lie , but if the words of politicians mean nothing , there 's little point in even having political discourse . political cynicism is no excuse to not put expectations on our candidates to be honest with the american people .
ref_sum ->  this is about politics and whether or not the lie in order to get more votes . __s1__ believes politicians sometimes may lie as long as its what is the majority , while s2 is saying that s2 is more concerned with the honesty of the candidates rather than whether they are lying or not . s2 says we should expect them to be honest , because that is what we should want from politicians . __s1__ argues that politicians seem to lie in order to get the position they want or sway people to become popular , while s2 thinks that we should rely on them to make the right decision . __s1__ seems to think that s2 is making an argument for their belief , but s2 is just trying to be honest and show the other perspective . they argue about politicians lying through discussing when politicians are asked questions and how they answer them . s2 finishes by telling __s1__ we should not label politicians and expect them to do and say the right , honest thing .
generated -> conservative republicans say the right thing on this issue will cost s2 more votes than it will gain you , everyone knows it , and no one is going to do it . it 's politics 101 , but if s2 are talking about a political party as a whole that 's unavoidable . so , s1 are basically saying that biden was lying through his teeth when he said he does n't support gay marriage ?

Article ->  dead '' potential '' lives do n't have '' real '' or '' actual '' dead bodies . when a __pre-birth__ child dies -lrb- either naturally or by the hands of a ' doctor ' paid to kill it -rrb- , ... it has a ' real ' body . not just a mere potential for one . there are plenty of photos and such on the net if s2 really need more convincing evidence . but if s2 ever want to debate it further , feel free to join me in the appropriate threads . are __s1__ finished trying to troll this thread yet for people to talk to __s1__ about abortion ? s2 am half tempted to start playing devil 's advocate and adopt your positions against gay rights here as a means to respond to __s1__ on abortion issues in the other threads . __s1__ would lose abortion arguments by the arguments __s1__ have raised here ... food for thought . couple a '' general welfare '' claim with the research that shows abortion has caused lower crime ... by __s1__ 's position , and by blindly repeating '' general welfare '' over and over again without addressing anything , not much __s1__ would be left with ... i 'll take that debate . anytime . oh . s2 recognize what __s1__ wanted __s1__ 's point to be ... s2 also recognize how __s1__ __flubbed__ up stating what __s1__ wanted to say ... and that 's where __s1__ went beyond being insulting . it 's like trying to argue that the __abortionists__ could have no qualms __exterminating__ jews in another holocaust . __s1__ should at least be honest enough to admit the boundaries that do exist , unilaterally . and by that logic , s2 could just as easily argue that those people who wanted to prevent gay marriage could just as easily want to prevent __inter-religious__ or __inter-racial__ marriage ... they could supposedly just as easily have wanted slavery back , if they are willing to deny people rights because of their differences ... if s2 thought __s1__ would learn anything meaningful to __s1__ from such a discussion , s2 would take __s1__ up on it ... but as it is , s2 have come to recognize __s1__ 's posting patterns enough to question how much __s1__ recognize the __fallibility__ of __s1__ 's own tactics ... at least we can agree on that much . __s1__ doubt s2 could learn anything ; also ! hey , ... will maine 's results have any bearing on the __scotus__ look at overturning the 9th -lrb- again -rrb- ? ya think ? see , that 's part of the problem . that 's not an issue we agree on . but __s1__ do n't recognize that ... why should it ? the '' 9th '' is about how the federal constitution applies to gay marriage . maine 's results were about how voters feel about gay marriage . two entirely separate issues ... while s2 recognize the following will be lost on you , s2 offer it __anyways__ ... bowers rationale does not withstand careful analysis . in his dissenting opinion in bowers justice stevens concluded that -lrb- 1 -rrb- the fact a state s governing majority has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice , and -lrb- 2 -rrb- individual decisions concerning the __intimacies__ of physical relationships , even when not intended to produce offspring , are a form of liberty protected by due process . lawrence v. texas the fact that a majority want a law is not enough to satisfy a constitutional challenge of that law . that much should be obvious . no , . . seriously ... . __s1__ doubt s2 would learn -lrb- accept , consider , absorb , __aquire__ -rrb- anything from such a debate . but , s2 are welcome to try to prove me wrong about that . california 's ban -lrb- being reviewed by the 9th -rrb- is likewise about '' the voters '' and their desired definition . see what __s1__ mean that it 's doubtful that s2 will learn anything from another exchange ? s2 do n't need to bother with an answer to that . __s1__ already know what it is likely to be . see , this is why s2 doubt __s1__ 's intellectual honesty in discourse . what __s1__ said was actually pretty witty , assuming it was n't done by accident . but __s1__ still choose to employ those __faculties__ for furthering flawed arguments , and dodging arguments __s1__ know __s1__ can not win . so __s1__ blindly repeat yourself , and think s2 have learned nothing . they are two entirely separate issues . but __s1__ pointing to issue a does not refute issue b . that is where __s1__ are flawed . it does n't matter how much '' desire '' the voters have . their law still has to be constitutional and meet the requirements of the 14th amendment . and until __s1__ can embrace an honestly open discussion on that , without repeating yourself ad __nausieum__ like a skipping record player , there is no point in __enjoining__ __s1__ on another subject .
ref_sum ->  this debate is about the 9th and how the federal constitution applies to marriage . __s1__ and s2 begin by talking about trolling and potentially starting a new debate on abortion , which does n't really have a lot of purpose in this conversation . s2 says that in saying people who want to get rid of gay marriage may have wanted to prevent __inter-racial__ and inter religious marriage . s2 states that maine 's vote on gay marriage was an opinion on gay marriage , rather than the 9th being how the federal constitution applies to gay marriage . s2 also says that bowers justice stevens does n't have the evidence to withstand his analysis . they also bring up lawrence v. texas and s2 states that even when majority wants a law it is n't enough for the constitution challenge of the law . s2 goes back to saying how __s1__ 's arguments are flawed and that its too repetitive for this conversation , because __s1__ has n't disproved anything . they go back to talking trash to each other and they end the conversation .

Article ->  s2 do know that the gay marriage debate is not synonymous with someone condoning violence against gays , right ? __s1__ seriously doubt anyone here does n't agree with s2 that gays should n't experience violence and name-calling , so that 's not even an issue on the table here . disagree and debate those who believe gay marriage is wrong all s2 want . but do n't dishonestly use arguments about violence , because no one here has argued for that . s2 is sorry , but have __s1__ read archie 's posts ??? he regularly __denigrates__ gays with a variety of slurs . and palin never asked for somebody to threaten obama either . but her rhetoric inflamed people to extremes that are grotesque . oh please . do n't start that subjective __canard__ again . if every religious person who genuinely disagreed with gay marriage because of their religion added a ' __but-no-violence__ ! ' __addendum__ to __everytime__ they weighed in on it , do s2 think anyone actually thinks s2 had be satisfied ? um ... no . it 's funny how the whole violence thing gets used as a __means-to-an-end__ tool by those who argue against religious people on this . well , it would be funny if it were n't sad to some extent . people should n't have to stop standing up for their principles just because of __nutcases__ out there . if the shoe fits ... s2 is talking about the people who proclaim abusive lies about gays . people who put out junk that makes people feel threatened by gays . telling people that gay marriage will makes their kids have to be taught about gay marriage ? that 's a threat . telling people that gay marriage will require churches to have to perform gay marriages ? that 's perceived as a threat too . s2 have no doubt that some people can discuss the subject without inciting . but on the prop 8 battle , the ads clearly were __inciteful__ . do __s1__ think that if a person talks about an abortion doctor '' killing babies '' , that does n't push somebody to think about claiming '' self-defense '' or '' defense of others '' ? how many people do __s1__ think are out there that have attacked a gay person that actually had somebody tell them '' s2 think __s1__ should go out and kill a gay person '' ? it 's built up toxicity from all the anti-gay rhetoric that reaches a boiling point . when the rhetoric __inflames__ , it 's obvious where it starts when somebody gets burned ... oh . and can s2 just say that while s2 am impressed __s1__ did n't try to attack me , __s1__ are doing a bad job of ignoring me ... yeah , when it fits . not other contexts . jason did n't make that distinction which is why __s1__ took issue with him on it . __s1__ did n't say __s1__ was going to start ignoring you , __foundit__ . __s1__ made clear __s1__ was done with that discussion . __s1__ did not say __s1__ was going to stop responding to s2 __foundit__ . and regarding s2 's comment about ' attacking ' , it 's because s2 's tone has changed in the last few posts -- s2 have turned off the hostility some , for __whatver__ reason , and it 's the nature of things that honey draws less flies than **** . that 's why s2 no longer perceive as being '' attacked . '' quite simply , s2 require a __fight-fire-with-fire__ approach , and so tone s2 are treated with -lrb- from me , anyway -rrb- depends entirely on you . and considering he was responding to archie , one of the guys who has got the worst track record on this message board for abusive slurs towards gays , s2 think he was right on track . oh . silly me . so that was just a lame attempt to dodge that conversation then . the one where s2 had just finished explaining how __s1__ were moving the __goal-posts__ and __obfuscating__ up a storm . s2 guess '' __clafclo__ '' was more successful than s2 thought . it 's amusing to watch __s1__ turn on __s1__ 's __passive-aggressive__ claims , and then turn them off again . when __s1__ need it as an excuse , you 'll start whining about '' attacks '' again , even as __s1__ drop claims that s2 should n't be a moderator of any board ... which s2 is sure is n't an '' attack '' or '' personal information '' in __s1__ 's book , hmmm ? and also , __s1__ 's response here is doing exactly what s2 noted on the other thread . __s1__ are dropping the majority of the topical text , and making more of an interest in that one __side-note__ comment ... __s1__ said __namecalling__ and violence , __foundit__ . those were the things jason __conflated__ with opposing gay marriage . once again s2 are being disingenuous again -- respond to what __s1__ actually said for once . show where archie has ever called gays names before , like the f word , or called for violence against gays . if s2 can , i 'll be glad to retract the comment . __namecalling__ and violence are wrong , regardless of where people fall on the issue of gay marriage . in fact , more importantly , they are always wrong no matter what the issue . whatever s2 want to think , __foundit__ . it 's not worth arguing over with a brick wall . __geeez__ __foundit__ . __s1__ suspect personal comments about posters are starting to compete or even outnumber pertinent points about issues s2 are making at this point . __s1__ think __s1__ is going to start using an __acronymn__ whenever s2 do so , that says personal comments & attacks do n't deal with issues . '' __pcaddwi__ '' . that way it will be noted when s2 do it , but it allow s2 to continue dragging down the thread with them . -lrb- or at least you 'll be completely alone in doing so . -rrb- __pcaddwi__ . quote him . quote exactly what he said . cause jason did no such thing ... were __s1__ looking in the mirror when __s1__ said that ? are __s1__ for real ? we have already got archie 's '' __bitchy__ as a gay '' comment . s2 never said he called gays '' __xxxxxx__ '' before . but ai n't it interesting how this board will sensor __######__ or __####__ , but if __s1__ say __xxxxxx__ , it 's __a-ok__ ... the fact that __s1__ argue with me on so many issues , but then throw this arbitrary argument out there , __belittles__ __s1__ 's claim and demonstrates an ulterior motive for ignoring the statement . are __s1__ going to label __s1__ 's own statements as such __jyoshu__ ? cause __s1__ have this boring habit of starting __passive-aggressive__ attacks , belittling other people , and then when somebody calls __s1__ on it or says something about it __s1__ eventually drop it and act surprised when other people point out __s1__ dropped it .
ref_sum ->  this is about the use of arguments of violence towards !!__gay-marriage__!! . __s1__ starts off saying there is a difference between being anti-gay and someone condoning violence against gay people . s2 talks about how violence is used to make people feel threatened to feel a certain way about a topic or debate . s2 used the example of kids being taught about gay marriage in school as a threat . s2 also mentions someone named archie who posts include a variety of slurs towards gay people . __s1__ brushes on the topic , but goes off track from the topic quite a bit . these two people start referring to each others `` attacks '' on each other towards the end . __s1__ says they were referring to !!__namecalling__!! and violence from the original post that was opposing gay rights . these two are n't really in opposite !!__positions/beliefs__!! , but they are more trying to discuss the ways they argue for or against gay marriage and how it may be portrayed by others .
generated -> s1 seriously doubt anyone here does n't agree with s2 . if every religious person who genuinely disagreed with gay marriage because of their religion added a ' but-no-violence !

Article ->  any two adults can run the household , one can make the decision if the other is incapacitated , one inherits when the other dies , etc etc. . that parallel does not carry over to group marriages . when one dies , who inherits ? if one is __incapacitied__ , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two , so __recongnising__ group marriages is a huge legal task , and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious . if we are talking about legal recognition , and we are -lrb- right ? -rrb- , then the cases are wildly different . our marriage laws , for better or worse , are set up on the assumption of two adults running a household . they also assume man and wife , true , but do n't actually depend on that . but the dependence on there being two people is embedded in the laws ; changing that is a huge project . yes , but gays would also want laws changed to __accomodate__ their form of marriage as well . the fact that one requires less change than the other should n't matter , should it ? should having to do more __reworking__ of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality ? it seems to me __s1__ 's argument boils down to '' polygamy requires more work to make the laws __accomodate__ it . '' yeah -- such is the price for marriage equality . let 's face it -- if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for __opposite-sex__ couples which comprise most relationships , they could pull it off -- polygamy , gays , letting 17 year olds marry , etc. . all those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed . means could be set up to determine inheritance , for example . laws can be worded to do it . see , this is why we try to avoid this debate . those who oppose gay marriage inevitably put their own spin on it and drag it to silly conclusion . here we see what gays really want turned into '' make marriage an open-ended institution of equality '' , which then means gay , poly , and 17 year olds in this case . __jyoshu__ stopped there , but it 's not uncommon for it then to go to children , cousins , dogs , whatever . this issue is not '' let 's let everyone do anything they like '' , that 's just the common __reframing__ we see whenever poly relations are brought up while __disscusing__ gay marriage . it happens all the time , it gets old , and that 's why people who have gone through it a bunch of times tend to __aviod__ the whole thing . it happens because there 's no way to avoid logical conclusions . believe it or not , cultural and legal precedent is a very real thing . the events in the article __exemplify__ this . if __s1__ argue to broaden marriage -lrb- which __s1__ are -rrb- , then this is what __s1__ have to deal with . as __s1__ said , s2 did stop with polygamy , gay , and barely lowering the age of consent , so why are you bringing up all the other examples like '' children , cousins dogs , '' or whatever , as if __s1__ were ready to pounce on that ? __s1__ are arguing against degrees that s2 did n't even say , or that no one said . now , do __s1__ have any response to s2 's point that __s1__ 's argument boils down to nothing more than '' polygamy requires more work to make the laws __accomodate__ it '' , or are __s1__ just going to avoid it by getting __sidetracked__ by the fact __s1__ do n't like that we are even talking about this ? again , society can deal with issues like polygamy if they really want to . sure there is . s2 can start with an erroneous assumption , like s2 did , and then arrive at an illogical conclusion , like s2 did . why do n't s2 read the exchanges between me and phyllis ; __s1__ think most of s2 's issues will be addressed that way . do __s1__ feel that opening marriage to gay couples is not a case of broadening marriage ? how is that an erroneous assumption ? sure , but s2 asked __s1__ some specific questions that __s1__ seem to be avoiding . in __s1__ 's exchange with phyllis s2 may comment on matters s2 disagree with . listen to yourself ! we start with '' gays want to get married '' , s2 change it to '' make marriage an open-ended institution of equality '' , and now s2 __segue__ over to '' broadening marriage '' . s2 's erroneous assumption is s2 's statement of what gays are trying to accomplish . until s2 stop trying to change what gays really want into something that s2 can argue against more easily all s2 's arguments will be based on erroneous assumptions . actually , __s1__ did address them . while debating with phyllis . naturally . and naturally __s1__ may ignore them if __s1__ think they are diversions . what gays are trying or not trying -lrb- in terms of intent -rrb- is not the issue . what is the crux here is that marriage would be broadened . it 's not rocket science . __s1__ are moving the boundaries of what constitutes a marriage to include more than __opposite-sex__ couples . very straightforward . s2 know __s1__ do n't like it __phrased__ that way , but that 's what it is . __s1__ ca n't take a phrase like ' gays want to get married '' without looking at the overall implications . in terms of legal rights , s2 do n't see why it would be any different . equality in marriage is equality in marriage regardless of the cultural motivation -- religious , being in love with more than one person , or simply just for the hell of it . for that matter , the argument could be made that __opposite-sex__ marriage between 2 people is largely a religious construct ! i 'll try to explain this to s2 one more time . the stated purpose of gays is quite __relevent__ if s2 are trying to argue against it . gays want to get married . one side effect of that is that some people will see the scope of marriage broadened . gays are not , in and of itself , trying to broaden marriage . they did not wake up one day and say '' let 's try to broaden the scope of marriage today , that 'll be fun ! '' s2 's arguments run along the lines of '' if s2 want to __braoden__ marriage , than s2 must __excpet__ it broadening in all these other ways '' and that 's why s2 's __rephrasing__ does n't work . broadening marriage is n't the goal , it 's a side effect , and since it is n't the goal we do n't have to accept all these other things s2 claim would be the result if they were trying to broaden marriage . to recap , s2 's arguments are based on s2 's assumption that gays want to broaden marriage , that that is their __ulitmate__ goal , the pinnacle of the cause . gays getting married to s2 seems to be the means to that end . that is , of course , backwards , and so s2 's __sematic__ based arguments fail . __kronos__ , s2 just told __s1__ s2 am not dealing here with what gays are trying / not trying to do in terms of intent , yet __s1__ are are arguing as if s2 never even said that . s2 am not arguing what gays have as intent . s2 completely understand what __s1__ are saying . s2 's point here is based on the effect of their intents , whatever that intent is . there is simply no way to get around the fact that if __s1__ change marriage to include other that __opposite-sex__ couples -lrb- to any number of other possibilities -- even one -rrb- , __s1__ are broadening marriage . whether or not gays set out out to do this in terms of a goal is irrelevant . __s1__ are attacking some point about intent that s2 have n't made -- s2 is talking about the effect here . to latch onto some straw man of '' intent '' is to completely miss the point . __s1__ is not ignoring this post , __s1__ is simply choosing not to respond because it 's a pointless distraction in an otherwise __interesing__ thread . if s2 want to start another thread on this theme i 'll explain there how wrong s2 are . well , __s1__ are the one that 's taking issue and making it a distraction !
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : !!__opposers__!! to gay marriage often jump to conclusions about who can get married - why not cousins , group marriages , children , dogs ? polygamous marriage raises legal concerns that are not currently covered in traditional marriage laws , for example . the goal of gay marriage supporters is to be able to get married - not to broaden marriage . broadened marriage is a side effect of legal gay marriage . s2 : gay marriage supporters want marriage laws changed to accommodate gay marriage . broadened marriage could change the current traditional marriage laws . polygamy , for example , would require more marriage laws changed than gay marriage would , as more people are involved . but if enough people wanted legal polygamous marriage , the laws would be passed . marriage would be broadened if gay marriage is made legal , whether that is the goal of gay marriage or not .
generated -> if one is incapacitied , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that parallel does not carry over to group marriages . if one is incapacitied , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two , so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task , and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious that

Article ->  do n't __s1__ think that in 1909 it was probably viewed mostly from a moral standpoint ? __s1__ do n't think they saw it the same way they would see black people . they did n't even realize that ' homosexuality ' was any sort of innate thing . it was entirely behavioral to them . __s1__ tend to agree with the court , even given what __s1__ have said . __s1__ doubt for 1909 it was about prejudice and bigotry -- they genuinely felt it was wrong . the concept of gay marriage was completely foreign and unknown in 1909 . it was n't even something they conceived of . __s1__ think the court is saying that they could n't have been prejudiced against something they did n't even know of or conceive of . __hogwash__ . it was once entirely moral to believe certain races were inferior , and that women had fewer rights than men . treating the races and women as equal was not something even thought of by many . it was prejudice against gays then , and it still is today . this is not really true . it 's a popular __misconstruing__ of morality and history by proponents of modern ' rights ' movements , but it 's not true . there 's little historical backing to the idea that people believed __oppressing__ black people was a right thing to do , as in , doing good . there were times they used an argument where religion was wrongly used to justify their behavior , but that 's a different matter . if s2 firmly believe otherwise , __s1__ had challenge s2 to show where people thought __oppressing__ blacks was an example if doing good . the same goes for misogyny . furthermore , it 's beside the point anyway . we are talking about homosexuality . in 1909 , the only thing they really understood about the issue at hand was that some people engaged in sexual relations with people of their own gender . there were no articles about '' homosexuality '' as a trait , and certainly none about genetic causes . it was understood entirely from a behavioral standpoint , and therefore a moral standpoint . so it 's not __hogwash__ at all -- they really did view gay sex as immoral . if s2 do n't think so , then s2 have a very poor grasp on history in this case . this kind of morality is based on nothing but ignorance -lrb- which __s1__ admit -rrb- and prejudice . what kind of a basis is that for a so-called moral code ? so what if it involves behaviour ? gay people have sex , develop relationships , and bond , just like everyone else , but in a way that reflects their gay sexuality . this does not mean people could not be prejudiced about the way gay people live . people were , and are so prejudiced . a better reverse analogy would have been to say '' so then __conversly__ __s1__ have the right to advocate that heterosexual relations are morally wrong '' . not __heterosexuality__ , since it 's not homosexuality -lrb- as it 's a state of being -rrb- that religious people have a problem with . heck , they often do n't even recognize it . with that caveat , yes s2 are certainly free to advocate whatever s2 want to be morally wrong . -lrb- and unlike the way some in s2 's movement do , __s1__ wo n't call s2 a '' bigot '' for doing so ! -rrb- it may have been based on '' ignorance '' , but __s1__ reject the notion it was based on prejudice -lrb- and therefore __s1__ tend to agree with the 6 - 0 view of the justices here -rrb- . the 1909 society had too little understanding of gay people to be prejudiced over in the first place . remember , homosexuality was not understood as a state of being at that time . the term itself had not been around long and was not known to most people . and even to those it was known to , it was not known as a state of being . and there certainly was no social identity among gay people as a group -- how could prejudice have existed if there was nothing -lrb- from their perspective -rrb- to be prejudiced toward ? right . provided gays do n't live gay , but live straight , gays can be as gay as they want . as long as gays do n't outwardly show what makes them different from __straights__ , gays can be as gay as they want . it 's bs . also some may not recognize the existence of gay people or their gay lives , but that is putting one 's head in the sand . nonsense . people would widely and __hatefully__ use the term '' __sodomite__ '' to refer to gays . before that the term was '' molly '' . clearly there was an identity they were prejudiced towards . they were rounding up gays in areas they were known to attend , and putting them in prison . read up on the trial of oscar wilde . gays may have been forced underground , to a greater extent , but that does not mean they were not thought of . gays were just not thought of in a nice way . gays were purposely kept out of everything in society , when society did n't really think of gays as human too . that is n't prejudice ? because they did n't approve of sodomy ! do s2 not agree they did n't understand the concept of homosexuality ??? there was no social identity . when they were put on trial , it was n't because they were gay -lrb- which they had no concept of -rrb- , it was because they had gay relations which society viewed as wrong ! no , here 's where s2 do n't get it -- it 's not that '' gays '' -lrb- there was no concept of that -rrb- were purposely kept out of of everything , it 's that people who had sodomy relationships were kept out of everything , because sodomy was viewed as wrong . they really did think it was wrong ! s2 are so determined to portray everything that has anything to do with gay relations possibly being wrong as prejudice and bigotry that s2 are __close-minded__ about it .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : in 1909 , being homosexual was morally wrong , and people could be prejudiced about something that they did not recognize as innate . there was little historical evidence to prove that people in 1909 believed that it was `` right '' or `` good '' to !!__oppress__!! black people or women , and this sentiment extend to homosexuals . in 1909 , people knew that gay sex occurred and they understood its occurrence to be entirely behavioral , and therefore , immoral . homosexuality was not understood as a social identity back then , so there was no `` gay lifestyle '' to be prejudiced against . sodomy was criminalized , not being gay . s2 : there was prejudice against gays in 1909 just as there is now . the !!__immorality__!! of homosexuality in 1909 is based on ignorance . as long as gay people `` lived straight '' , they could be as sexually !!__non-normative__!! as they wanted to be . there were terms for gay men back then , like !!__sodomite__!! and molly , so there was a clear identity for people to be prejudiced against . men who `` acted gay '' were punished for it in 1909 .

Article ->  we all know the possibility exists . __s1__ simply have n't seen anyone present any even half way convincing argument that any of those possibilities are , in fact , a reality . all __s1__ are saying is '' they say it 's morals '' which is no argument at all . calling a tail a leg , etc. . furthermore , why do __s1__ start with the premise that it 's prejudice , rather than needing proof of that -lrb- instead expecting proof of a negative -- that it 's not -rrb- ? __s1__ did n't start with that premise , it 's simply the most likely answer . __s1__ know of no moral system that condones hurting others when said harm is n't preventing some other harm , so morals are out . religion is a good reason for choosing s2 's own actions but it 's no reason for telling others how to live , so that 's out . prejudice against gays has been around for ages , so that 's quite likely . and no other explanations come to mind . straight forward . __s1__ is sure __s1__ have explained this to s2 before , and have invited s2 to come up with alternate explanations . __s1__ do so again . __s1__ is particularly interested to see s2 's response now that s2 seem to have gotten over the idea that simply calling something moral or religious does not mean that it ca n't be prejudice at the same time . and neither does christianity . it too is a moral system . that 's why when people claim religion in their acts of prejudice , they are actually abandoning that moral system , rather than engaging in it . so yes , morals are out -- s2 is glad __s1__ are seeing that now . so s2 finally see that people can claim a moral or religious stance while not actually having one ? excellent ! glad to hear it . now , care to address the matter at hand ? can s2 show me , preferably in reality as opposed to a hypothetical , how one could justify pushing an anti-gay agenda based on actual morals or religion ? because __s1__ have never seen it myself . nice attempt at trying to refute a point that has n't even been made here . the matter at hand is that prejudice may in fact not be what 's behind people 's opposition to gays being in romantic relationships . in some cases -lrb- well , s2 had say many cases -rrb- it 's religious belief , which may be separate from prejudice . the people s2 have been around who __fel__ that way were doing it because of their religious beliefs . in fact , it 's my reason as well . actually it was __s1__ 's point . s2 have refused to acknowledge this so many times in the past that __s1__ could n't even count . __s1__ is glad s2 are past it now . fine , than if it 's s2 's reasoning than spell it out for me . do n't worry about anyone else 's reasoning , just give me yours . take me , step by step , from '' this is __s1__ 's religious belief '' to '' therefore other people should n't be gay -lrb- or act gay or whatever -rrb- '' . leave nothing out , spell out s2 's assumptions , give me the whole ball of wax . because in all __s1__ 's years __s1__ have never once seen anyone come close to doing so without resorting to prejudice . for bonus points extend it all the way to '' and so public policy __disadvantageous__ to gays should be enacted '' . s2 have never said that people ca n't claim to have a moral belief and not really have one . people can conceivably lie about anything -- we ca n't base our discussion on the worry that people might be lying about their stance ; that could be the case in any situation about any issue . no , it 's a religious belief . there 's no more '' reasoning '' to it than believing in faith that christ is a __ressurected__ being . s2 believe it because it 's biblical -- it 's what the bible says . that 's why s2 believe people should n't do it . it 's not so complicated , really . no one is saying you have to believe that way . but it is the way s2 believe , and that 's s2 's business . if s2 imposed s2 's beliefs , that would be one thing , but s2 do n't . s2 do n't impose anything on __s1__ or anyone else , nor do s2 want to . get it ? and yet __s1__ ca n't see how s2 made that jump . s2 believe , fine . but why should n't other people do it ? what do s2 's beliefs have to do with other people 's actions ? so s2 do n't impose ? s2 do n't take any action which could have an obvious negative impact on another person based solely on s2 's religious beliefs ? if that 's true than __s1__ have no problem with you , and s2 are not one of the people __s1__ is talking about here . __s1__ did specify people pushing an anti-gay agenda after all . are s2 saying that the people in '' focus on the family '' , or whatever they are called , are in fact doing wrong then ? since they are clearly trying to impose their views on others , which s2 and __s1__ seem to agree is wrong .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : religion is a good tool to guide one 's own actions , but not for telling others how to live . people have been prejudiced against homosexuals for a long time . moral or religious prejudice is still prejudice . a person can claim a moral or religious stance without having one . you can not justify an anti-gay agenda on morals or religion . an anti-gay stance on the grounds of religious belief is prejudice . prejudice based on religious belief implies that a religious person 's acts of prejudice could have a negative impact on homosexuals , because they believe that being gay is morally reprehensible . s2 : prejudice is a fact of human existence . christianity is a moral system . when people claim religion in morals , they abandon that moral system . it is religious belief - not prejudice - that makes one take an anti-gay stance . the bible says that homosexuality is wrong , so if you believe in the bible as your moral canon , then you believe that homosexuality is wrong as well .
generated -> s1 simply have n't seen anyone present any even half way convincing argument that any of those possibilities are , in fact , a reality . all s1 are saying is they say it 's morals '' which no argument at all ``

Article ->  new england and new york will probably have gay marriage within the next few years . the west coast might also follow suit after that . __s1__ think the recent wave of gay marriage legalization will stop for the next 20 years or so after that . 30 states already define marriage as between a man and a woman . do n't be so sure . if congress removes doma and with roberts and alito on the court same sex marriage will come to the rest of the country with a 7 to 2 ruling . roberts and alito are constitutional __literalists__ and with doma out of the way the full faith and credit clause is a clear constitutional mandate . can s2 demonstrate evidence that the __scotus__ would nullify gay marriage bans in all states ? if the __scotus__ was so imposed , why do n't they just strike doma down right now and then declare all gay marriage bans unconstitutional ? secondly , states can choose not to recognize gay marriage even without federal doma . there is a choice of law doctrine that allows states to not recognize other states marriages that they find '' offensive '' to their own public policy . states have been not recognizing each others marriages for decades and states do not use the __ffc__ clause to make one state recognize another 's marriage . there is no case history of __ffc__ ever used in this way . even in cases where it has been attempted , the legal argument involved is so lengthy , that it effectively prohibits __ffc__ use due to the sheer amount of hassle and legal proceedings involved in winning such a case . it is called the constitution of the united states a marriage license is a public act and record which __http__ are obviously ignorant of . __http__ completely failed to respond to the choice of law doctrine , as well as __s1__ 's request that __http__ provide justification on __http__ 's claims of how each justice would vote , as well as __s1__ 's challenge to __http__ to explain why doma has not been declared unconstitutional if __http__ 's claims about the justices were true . apparently , the law is beyond __http__ 's comprehension , as is __http__ 's ability to consider facts in forming __http__ 's opinions . in answer to __s1__ 's question . steven , kennedy , souter , ginsburg , and breyer will side with us . roberts and alito will follow the constitution as written . scalia and thomas are a lost anti gay cause . that is how s2 know how they will vote . as to why doma has not been declared unconstitutional is because there has not been a case in the courts challenging doma and so has not been taken up by __scotus__ . i 'll do a little research on s2 's claims . regardless , s2 still failed to address how state courts may use the choice of law doctrine so that the __ffc__ clause does not apply , and if it were , the sheer complication of applying the law would make it effectively prohibitive . by all means , post up the __ffc__ clause again so s2 can avoid addressing this . s2 do not see how choice of law doctrine is not trumped by the full faith and credit clause in cases of marriage contract since there is a current tradition of one state respecting other states marriage licenses when it comes to __heteros__ . the choice of law doctrine is used to settle differences between different state laws . that is how the law is practiced , and that is what courts believe . again , states have been disagreeing on the validity of each other 's marriages for decades and there has been no case history of the full faith and credit clause that has made one state recognize another state 's marriage . courts look to the choice of law doctrine before the __ff__ & c c.
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : legally , it is complicated to legalize gay marriage in all states , as doma is in place and states have chosen not to recognize other state 's marriages for decades . attempts abide by the __ffc__ clause to in respect to marriage -lrb- even before doma -rrb- require such lengthy legal arguments that they are rendered prohibitive . the choice of law doctrine must be considered and doma could be found to be unconstitutional by vote of the __scotus__ . how will states use the choice of law doctrine so that the __ffc__ clause does not apply ? s2 : if congress removes doma , a vote for legal gay marriage will pass quickly , and certain justices of __scotus__ already approve of gay marriage . doma has yet to be declared unconstitutional because there has yet to be a case made to challenge doma in the courts , so it has not been decided upon by __scotus__ . the choice of law doctrine trumps the __ffc__ clause in cases of marriage contract and there is a current tradition of respecting other states marriage licenses for .
generated -> s1 think the recent wave of gay marriage legalization will stop for the next 20 years . if congress removes doma and with roberts and alito on the court same sex marriage will come to the rest of the country with a 7 to 2 ruling . if congress removes doma and with roberts and alito on the court same sex marriage will come to the rest of the country with a 7 to 2 ruling .

Article ->  withers dc council votes for gay marriage by james withers , contributing editor , 365 gay blog __12.15.2009__ pm est in a 11 - 2 vote , the city council of washington , dc voted for gay marriage . we are a bit __short-handed__ today , so expect more about this later . until then have a sip of the bubbly and congrats to the district . wait until it 's put on a ballot for the voters to decide . this is n't the first time that a liberal government did n't pay attention to the will of the people . and what is the will of the people jp ? people in support of marriage equality is steadily growing . compare the polls from ten years ago to now to see ... it is only a matter of time before equality stands upon the side of the majority . s2 keep hearing gays say that but every time it 's put to a vote , __s1__ lose . s2 had say that it 's time to try another tact because the current one is a losing proposition . the only thing forcing gay marriage on a population does is galvanize them against the forced action . and when they respond on the ballot , they do so __punatively__ . just wait until __s1__ see the repercussions of the current efforts to give all federal employee 's same sex partners __bennies__ on our dime despite doma . s2 is guessing that some additional democratic heads will roll in the fall election if that flies . __s1__ need a pr strategy that highlights the advantages of gay unions over __bathhouse__ and gay bar __existences__ . s2 believe that a true majority of people would support civil unions but not marriage . and s2 count myself amongst that majority . actually jp so far 5 states have passed gay marriage so no not every time it is put to a vote do we lose . and how am __s1__ forcing anyone to accept gay marriage ? am __s1__ forcing these voters to attend __s1__ 's wedding or dare __s1__ say be in a marriage themselves ? and __s1__ can not agree with s2 more about changing the image of the gay community as a whole . . we are not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people running around ... what __s1__ find funny is once strait people find out how boring we really are , and how we pay taxes just like every other joe __schmo__ they 'll think nothing more of special rights lol ... but actually like __s1__ stated earlier in another thread if those unions constituted the same legal rights as married couples __s1__ would be content . which 5 states put gay marriage on the ballot and it won ? to the best of s2 's knowledge , no state that has gay marriage today has ever gotten it via the ballot . it has either been the court or legislature that has forced it on the state . the gays s2 know are as boring as mr and mrs john q. public as well , but that 's not the image that is portrayed to the general public . like s2 said , __s1__ have a pr problem . s2 think that if more gays were willing to settle for civil unions that were more equivalent to marriage , __s1__ had have an easier time gaining legal acceptance . ok maybe not the ballot ... got me there man . lol ... . maine was a close one though . and yeah we got a major pr problem big time ... and __s1__ said as long as we got the legal rights of marriage and called it __cu__ __s1__ would be cool with that . __s1__ already wear a dress and heels enough as it is ! __lmao__ jk ... . s2 hope that you , at least , shave __s1__ 's legs . __;-rrb-__ oh __s1__ do ... __lmao__ __naw__ __s1__ do n't wear a dress __s1__ would n't look good in one ...
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : washington dc ' s city council recently legalized gay marriage . people 's support of gay marriage has been growing steadily in the past ten years , and will soon be the majority opinion . five states have already legalized gay marriage . those opposed to gay marriage may view gays as promiscuous and sexual !!__deviants__!! , but most gay men are !!__assuredly__!! quite normal . civil unions will not be accepted in place of marriage , as they do not allow the same legal rights as marriage . s2 : councils and legislatures may vote in favor of gay marriage , but it has yet to be the majority vote of the people . gay marriage should be played in a positive light by its supporters , because the current public perception of gay men is that they are promiscuous and lead a `` gay lifestyle '' that is offensive . anti-gay marriage supporters will support civil unions in lieu of gay marriage , and homosexuals should be satisfied with that .

ref_sum ->  two people are discussing gay relationships . __s1__ is in favor of these unions while s2 does not support them . __s1__ compares homosexual relationships to those of men who practice multiple marriage contending homosexuals are more committed to fidelity than those who believe in multiple marriage . s2 begs the question of how anyone can say that a man who believes in and practices multiple marriage does not love all of his wives . s2 cites a 2003 study advising at that time , 62 % of americans were not in favor of gay unions . __s1__ believes the roots are deeper than that particular poll . s2 feels he has a constitutional right to be opposed to gay marriage as well as gay people themselves .
generated -> at least 2 men in a loving , comitted relationship follow the pratice of fidelity , unlike the man who has 1 wife for each day of the week . how do s1 know that the man who has 1 wife for each day of the week does n't love his wives , or is n't committed to them . same for the wives toward their husband ? just curious ? s1 never stated that the husband or wives were not comitted to each other , s1 brought up the idea of fidelity .

Article ->  well ... so far eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue have found that barring same-sex marriage is unconstitutional . we are waiting to hear about three or four more . as for the nature of marriage , it is both a legal contract and -lrb- sometimes -rrb- a religious ceremony -lrb- sacrament in some religions -rrb- . we are stuck with the __duality__ , whether we like it or not , and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect . different religions can do what they want . they found that it violated their state __constitutions__ , right ? this has nothing to do with the us constitution . the winning arguments were based largely on state constitutional provisions that closely parallel , if not outright __mimmick__ , the federal constitution . that 's not generally true , is it ? for example , the massachusetts ruling was based on a specific provision in the mass. constitution that prohibits discrimination based on sexual preference . there 's nothing like that in the us constitution . and s2 's overall point was that we should be careful when calling something '' unconstitutional '' , in that we should be clear it we are talking state or federal constitution . many state __constitutions__ guarantee rights that are n't in the __fedral__ constitution . there 's nothing like that in the mass. . constitution either . though , it 's a __darned__ good idea ! goodrich was decided on equal protection grounds , citing the mass. document . __s1__ had have to look up the others to see the exact reasoning , but they are not likely to be far afield from the bedrock principles of equal protection and due process . gay rights is a real test of our constitutional system , and , so far , we are not passing with flying colors ... __s1__ are right , s2 __misremembered__ . it 's just __descrimination__ based on sex that 's banned .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing the issue of marriage equality . both subjects seem to be on the fence with the issue . __s1__ cites that eight of nine supreme courts have contended same sex marriage to be unconstitutional . s2 questions how gay marriage would violate someone 's constitutional rights . __s1__ advises the bulk of the arguments were based on state __constitutions__ which mirror the federal constitution . s2 uses the example of massachusetts ' allowing gay marriage under its state constitutional law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation . __s1__ contends there is no such piece to the massachusetts constitution . s2 then concedes he was incorrect about the citing and the law actually banned only discrimination based on gender and not sexual orientation .
generated -> marriage , it is both a legal contract and -lrb- sometimes -rrb- a religious ceremony -lrb- sacrament in some religions -rrb- , whether we like it or not , and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect . the winning arguments were based on state constitutional provisions that closely parallel , if not outright mimmick , the federal constitution .

Article ->  it would lead ultimately down the road to a marriage bill for __polygamists__ . that is why the current push for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage also contains a provision banning polygamous marriage as well . hmm ... . some opposition to the petition ... more left wing ideology at work . if the man after god s own heart had multiple wives , why can t i ? have heard others say that we already have polygamy in america . it s called serial polygamy because of our liberal divorce laws . so now those that are opposed to even more laws on the books and a return to old testament practices are considered left wing ? what s this world coming too ? lol king david having multiple wives was under old testament practice . jesus himself stated that divorce laws were granted by moses and allowed by god because of the __hardness__ of the people hearts . jesus said a man shall leave his father and mother and be __cleaved__ to his wife , not wives . __btw__ , its called serial __monogamy__ . if its ' right wing ' to support a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage than its ' left wing ' to oppose a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage . so is it a sin or just a practice ? s2 don t remember jesus saying polygamy was wrong . the statement __s1__ referred to does indicate that he was talking about a single wife , but s2 __wouldn__ t base a whole social convention on one word out of a whole book . anyway the jews don t believe in the new testament . would it be okay for them ? man s2 screwed that one up . s2 ll try to be a little more articulate in the future . okay was just wondering . base 's wing on what think is correct , not left or right . a few years ago it was right wing to be against the deficit , now it seems to be left wing . but that just shows what know about wings . lol the idea that it is now left wing to be against deficits is absurd . numerous democrats actually wanted to spend more than the bush administrations 12.5 % increase in federal spending . s2 was basing that on __s1__ 's previous statement in other words , anything that is opposed to one wing must be the opposite so s2 don t see how it s absurd unless __s1__ want to call __s1__ 's original statement absurd . this is obviously not the thread for this discussion but s2 will reply this time and see where it takes us . __s1__ __didn__ t state what __s1__ considered to be numerous nor did __s1__ supply anything to back up that statement . however deficits depend on both increased spending and lower revenues . bush has done both with large tax cuts and large discretionary spending increases . and even the conservatives are beginning to criticize him for being a big spending president . over the past 23 years , conservative administrations have increased the deficits and liberal administrations have decreased the deficits . so yeah it looks to me like left wing is against deficits and right wing is for deficits .
ref_sum ->  two people are debating the topic of gay marriage rights . __s1__ believes allowing gays to marry will open up the door to legalize other types of marriage such as polygamy . s2 holds to the theory that if king david was able to have multiple wives , why then should the common man not be able to , especially if religion is to now be the basis for all laws . __s1__ contends that practice was of the old testament and is no longer considered commonplace . s2 feels __s1__ is too left wing to entertain the thought of allowing gay marriage , but uses religion as the basis even though there are so many contradictions between the old testament and what is considered the new testament .
generated -> some opposition to the petition ... more left wing ideology at work . if the man after god s own heart had multiple wives , why can t i ? have heard others say that we already have polygamy in america that

Article ->  __s1__ think a better comparison is __sodom__ ... . these are the comments that make __s1__ a homophobic bigot , not __s1__ 's opposition to gay marriage . in s2 's mind yes ... . when s2 have bath houses in sf that have 100 men in a daisy chain performing unprotected sex on one another __s1__ would make the comparison to __sodom__ ... . that is not homophobic , that is a fact and s2 should condemn it too ... . so , __s1__ have been there to see this s2 take it or are __s1__ going on rumors and misinformation . did __s1__ read about this on the focus on family website ? sorry , s2 just do n't believe you . go to yahoo and do a search on san francisco gay bath houses if s2 do n't believe me ... . when the aids first came out they were shut down but they are flourishing again now and the occupants have gone back to unprotected sex ... . from what __s1__ have surmised s2 are gay . __s1__ am surprised s2 did not know that ... . you made a very specific claim about 100 men in a daisy chain having unprotected sex . it is clear to me that post was not based in fact , but opinion . if __s1__ do n't have the proof of the claim , __s1__ should n't make it ! that is what makes __s1__ a __homophobe__ . __s1__ make claims about gays without knowing the truth . why do s2 think they closed the bath houses down in the eighties ? this , at last check is 2005 , what they did in the 80 's has nothing to do with the topic at hand , or __s1__ 's comments . so either justify __s1__ 's comments or take them back and admit they were __uncalled__ for ... joe s2 need to read the link __s1__ cited in a post in this thread ... . gays in sf are trying to get the bath houses reopened ... . great ! what does that have to do with gay rights ? what does it have to do with the title of this thread ? how can __s1__ take what a small group of gays in california are doing and equate it to the behaviors of all gays . that is irresponsible .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ is against gay rights apparently because of the biblical story of __sodom__ , and the sexual activities __s1__ perceives to have occurred in san francisco bath houses , which __s1__ asserts the current gay community is trying to re-open . he argues that the gay community is going back to unprotected sex and that a daisy chain of 100 men perform unprotected sex on each other in the bath houses . s2 challenges the assumptions , specifically finding the daisy chain of 100 men a less than credible assertion and !!__admonishes__!! __s1__ to use facts to support his arguments , not opinions . s2 also notes that __s1__ 's apparent fascination with bath houses is not relevant to the gay rights topic under which the posts are being entered .

ref_sum ->  prior to this dialog , s2 apparently likened the gay marriage movement to the civil rights movement of the african american community . __s1__ is offended by the alleged analogy , finding a material distinction between race and sexual orientation . she suggests that to view it otherwise would be an insult to all african americans . s2 points out that two presumably prominent african american figures , !!__corretta__!! scott king and __jullian__ bond , are !!__pro-gay__!! marriage . __s1__ questions whether they do in fact support gay marriage , and s2 provides links to support his assertion . __s1__ accepts the evidence and concedes that some african americans may not be as insulted by the analogy and wonders how martin luther king felt about the issue of gay marriage .
generated -> yep , coretta scott king and jullian bond are against gay rights . s1 did say '' all african americans `` '' we are for gay marriage ? we are talking about gay marriage ``

Article ->  agreed , when the husband is part of a __hetero__ relationship . gay husband is not a legally recognized category . agreed , when the wife is part of a __hetero__ relationship . gay wife is not a legally recognized category . agreed , when the spouse is part of a __hetero__ relationship . gay spouse is not a legally recognized category . so the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem . what is the reason it 's not legally recognized ? because the couple is gay . where do __s1__ get the figure of 500,000 gay couples who want to immediately be married ? would these gay couples beat the straight couples in some kind of a race to the weddings occurring at the same time , or occurring over the course of a month or a year ? they are not legally recognized because they do n't meet the legal criteria for marriage , ie one man , one woman . a cat does n't meet the legal definition of a dog . do we change the definition of dog to appease the cat ? that 's the real question to be answered by society . actually , __s1__ pulled the number out of the air for __illustrative__ purposes only , but after reading the cbo report , __s1__ see that __s1__ was n't far off . they predicted 600,000 gay couples would want to get married it allowed . this is circular reasoning however . it 's stating that marriage simply is heterosexual , and so completely ends debate . exactly __s1__ 's point , just as a cat can never be considered a dog just because someone wants it to be . to me , and __s1__ is guessing millions of others , the term gay marriage is an __oxymoron__ . that 's not to say that we should n't consider the possibility of allowing gay unions with , possibly , equivalent rights to __hetero__ couples if we , as a society , see the benefit in doing so . for example , prior to fdr , the concept of state welfare was considered ludicrous and unconstitutional , but he was able to get enough support -lrb- and enough political muscle -rrb- to change society 's mind on the role of the federal gov ' t once he demonstrated the '' good '' that doing so had on america in its most dire time of need . people were willing to sacrifice a little freedom for security just as ben franklin had warned against . now , i 'll be the first to tell s2 that __s1__ think fdr was the biggest threat to american freedom that ever existed , but one ca n't argue his ability to change public opinion on the role of the federal gov ` t . it concerns reason , as __jaxian__ said earlier . what are the logical reasons for marriage discrimination against gays and lesbians ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ does not believe that anyone outside of a heterosexual marriage should be considered a husband , wife or a spouse because legally they are not . this person believes that the term gay marriage is an __oxymoron__ because marriage , legally , to them , is only between one man and one woman . they believe that prior to roosevelt , society did not accept the idea of state welfare as constitutional , but because people were willing to sacrifice freedom for security , they eventually caved to his ideas . s2 does not believe that marriage is simply between one man and one woman , and that the entire reason behind the debate is so that homosexual marriage can and will be legally recognized . they do not see a reason for discrimination against homosexual marriage .
generated -> s1 pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only , but after reading the cbo report , s1 see that s1 was n't far off . it 's stating that marriage simply is heterosexual , and so completely ends debate that

Article ->  __s1__ 's __apologizies__ . __s1__ read it hastily and got it completely __bassackwards__ . the cbo estimate in 's link did , indeed , say that the result would be up to ~ $ 1 billion surplus . so __s1__ also recognize that __s1__ 's argument that same-sex marriage does not benefit society is also '' __bassackwards__ '' ? finally ! some progress . remember ... this thread is supposed to be about fiscal concerns . __s1__ have conceded that it does n't have the negative financial impact that __s1__ thought it would . that was the purpose for __s1__ 's attempting to have a civil debate on what __s1__ thought the issues were . __s1__ had like to move past the fiscal concerns and onto the moral and health concerns if we can continue to do s2 with civility . gosh , s2 love a good typo ! in any case , s2 suppose a tepid concession is all we can expect . good catch . and s2 were hoping for ... ? a forthright concession . any maybe some discussion of how same-sex marriage benefits society in practical ways . instead , we are off to __s1__ 's safe ground of '' morality '' . safe , not because __s1__ are right , but because morality is relative and is subjective . __s1__ was hoping that s2 had be telling me the benefits , not vice versa . but s2 forget , __s1__ is not one of '' those '' who feels the need to impose __s1__ 's morality on everyone else . __s1__ is more than willing to let society as a whole determine its own limits . while __s1__ is a staunch defender of the constitution -lrb- as written , not as interpreted -rrb- , __s1__ is way more flexible with public determined acceptable standards of behavior . i 'll even cut __s1__ 's grass so that it is the same level as __s1__ 's neighbors .

Article ->  should they ? what are western standards ? what were they 20 yrs ago ? what were they 100 yrs ago ? marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract . where would that put families started by artificial insemination ? the same as any other heterosexual couple . it 's not the way children are created -lrb- adopted , __serrogacy__ , etc -rrb- . it ' s the nature of the relationship -lrb- heterosexual -rrb- . natural refers to nature not child bearing . which god enforces marriage rules when the __cermony__ is __performend__ by a judge ? there was a tribe in the congo that allowed it . their __shamans__ told them that the warriors could only marry outer warriors . to be with a women , they thought , might make then softer , and more woman like , and not as fearless in combat . ok , so conceiving a child is not what makes it nature , what is it ? __wouldn__ t polygamy also include some of that same sex taboo , to women marred together ? why do __s1__ feel __s1__ 's values are right and others that disagree as wrong ? polygamy is not women married together . it 's one man or women married to multiple of the opposite sex like a harem or entourage . everyone feels their values are right or else they would n't believe in them . what we value shows . of course atheist do n't believe in god so they have a different set of values . __s1__ of course believe in god first , family second , and country third . if s2 have different values then of course s2 will think yours are better if not then s2 would n't have them . our values are what guide us . __s1__ feel that from perspective __s1__ 's values give someone a better balance and stability to function in society . s2 probably think otherwise but __s1__ feel statistically __s1__ can support mine . sorry , s2 don t practice polygamy ; s2 don t know the inner workings of the family . s2 would think it would be a good way for __bi-sexual__ to stay below the radar . s2 worded the question badly ; s2 should have asked why do __s1__ feel that __s1__ 's morals should be forced on to others ? by keeping the laws the way they are now it is discrimination . correct me if s2 am wrong , but s2 did not think __s1__ could fire some one for being gay . it 's all good __s1__ did n't think s2 knew what s2 were talking about __anyways__ ? the questions is why should they force their moral on us ? should we let other people like nudist and rapist force their __mroals__ on us ? how is allowing them to marry forcing there morals on us ? yes we would have to deal with the fact of it , but the us has been dealing with the fact of polygamy fro years . there is only one case that was prosecuted in recent history -lrb- that was mostly due to one of his wives being 14 when married . when society __legalizes__ behavior it is in fact accepting it as __non-detrimental__ and accepting it . it is a form of forcing our society to accept the behavior .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ makes the claim that marriage is defined as a family unit based on natural heterosexual contact , and suggests that it is the heterosexual nature of the relationship that is important , not how the children are conceived within the relationship . he argues that homosexuals are attempting to force their morals on others by legalizing same-sex marriage , claiming that legalizing a behavior is a tacit form of acceptance that will affect society . s2 questions the religious basis of a civil ceremony like marriage , suggesting that the !!__stipulations__!! based on religious reasons would vary depending on the chosen religion . he also compares homosexuality to polygamy , claiming that polygamy has been unofficially accepted for years , and argues that maintaining the current same-sex marriage bans should be considered discriminatory .
generated -> marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract . where would that put families started by artificial insemination ? the same as any other heterosexual couple . which god enforces marriage rules when the cermony is performend by a judge ? there was a tribe in the congo that the warriors could only marry outer warriors .

Article ->  __duh__ ??? what do __s1__ mean by that ? -lrb- hint ; read below __s1__ 's name below . -rrb- one could only wish that modern liberalism was truly __jeffersonian__ . if it were , s2 had be a liberal too . ok . i 'll ask s2 the same question what do __s1__ mean by that ? jefferson 's views were that democracy was with power of the people . he also understood the need for war when it comes to pursuing , __perserving__ and maintaining liberty -lrb- '' the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots & tyrants . it is its natural manure '' -rrb- . he believed liberty was threatened by a consolidated , centralized government , which is radically different than liberalism today , which takes the very opposite stance , __imo__ . __decentralization__ was a big theme to jefferson . he would have opposed __over-regulation__ . liberalism today has abandoned a lot of what jefferson believed , kept what they prefer , and changed it . there are many aspects of his liberalism s2 would agree with like their focus on domestic social issues such as taking care of elderly , making sure there is fairness , freedom for black people , etc. . but liberalism as embodied today by the democratic party has become __anti-religion__ , __over-regulatory__ , and it 's been taken over by extremist special interest groups such as the gay lobby and others -lrb- much the same way the republicans were taken over by the religious right in the 80 s -rrb- . it 's a political favor game now , not honest advocacy for the people as jefferson would have had it . are not doing the exact same thing ? did perhaps mean '' would agree with '' '' making sure there is fairness '' and '' honest advocacy '' , except for gay people . ??? no , that 's why s2 support equal opportunity for people regardless of their sexual behavior . but s2 do n't support redefining the marriage standard in this country , either . oh . so '' marriage '' is only for __hetrosexual__ people who use sex only for __procreation__ only in the missionary position ?
ref_sum ->  s2 suggests that he would be liberal if modern liberalism was actually __jeffersonian__ , meaning that democracy is viewed as the power of the people . he cites jefferson 's beliefs that war can be necessary in order to maintain liberty and that centralized government is a threat , and points out how these beliefs are the opposite of modern liberalism . he further claims that the current democratic party is __anti-religion__ , __over-regulatory__ , and controlled by the gay lobby . __s1__ !!__interprets__!! s2 's argument as a claim that fairness should exist for all people except homosexuals . s2 !!__clarifies__!! that he does support equal opportunity for all people regardless of their sexual behavior , but that he is still opposed to redefining the traditional view of marriage by legalizing same-sex marriage for homosexuals .
generated -> theme to jefferson of what do s1 mean by that ? jefferson 's views were that democracy was with power of the people . he also understood the need for war when it comes to pursuing , perserving and maintaining liberty -lrb- '' the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with that jefferson 's views were that democracy was truly jeffersonian . liberalism today has abandoned a lot of what jefferson believed , kept what they prefer , and changed it .

Article ->  we do n't just benefit from what is often considered the common , nuclear family . we benefit from families with adopted children , step children , families with no children at all . no it does not . prove it will come up , and also prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . marriage is that now . s2 are right , it has nothing to do with the bible . it has everything to do with the slippery slope logical __fallacy__ , which we have discussed in the forum ad __nauseum__ . it only shows that those opposed do not have an argument . s2 know the prospect of incest and polygamy is much less socially acceptable than gay marriage , so s2 try to erroneously tie polygamy and incest to gay marriage in people 's mind to strike fear in them , and hope their logical reasoning can be replaced by irrational fear . a married couple as the head of a home is considered a nuclear family it already has . the question of legality is what this whole issue is about . marriage is a legal __instituation__ , how could legality not come up . yes it is whoa ... hold up ... are __s1__ saying that only because gay marriage is less unacceptable that incestuous relations , that its ok to grant gay marriage but not sibling marriage ?? if the incestuous society begin to parade and protest , until society accepts them on the level that they accept gays now , what will __s1__ say then ? on what grounds should we discriminate against 2 siblings wanting to get married , particularly if they believe they truly love each other , or if they believe that they were born with that attraction ? this is classic __hypocracy__ . if 2 siblings want to love each other in their private lives , how is that any business of yours ? and what does irrational fear have to do with anything ? do __s1__ have an irrational fear of an incestuous or polygamous lifestyle ? based on what ? give me one reason why society __shouldnt__ accept an incestuous relation between two consenting adults then what may lead to incest and polygamy is the fact that marriage is a legal institution , is that what s2 are saying ? if so , these things may come up equally as a result of straight legal marriage or gay legal marriage or interracial legal marriage , or legal __inter-faith__ marriage or legal marriage with legal divorce , etc. . it does n't relate specifically to gay legal marriage at all . __s1__ was saying this is how many people attempt an argument against gay marriage , by attempting to incite fear by spouting off a parade of __horribles__ that have nothing to do with the issue of gay marriage . what if straight people are married and winged green monkeys come flying out of everyone 's derriere in the future ? what will s2 do then ? demonstrate how gay marriage specifically relates to incest and incestuous marriage and polygamy . this is the gay rights forum , not the incest forum . thats not what im saying . what may lead to incestuous marriage is if siblings or related people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . and what may lead to polygamous marriage is 3 or more people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . do __s1__ see a pattern here ? __ooooh__ . . nice way to snake out of the issue ... let me refresh __s1__ 's memory since __s1__ brought it up , what exactly does the social acceptance of any type of '' taboo '' relationship have to do with their right to be legally married ? is there a certain limit of '' __tabooness__ '' , and if __youre__ past that limit then no marriage for you ? and what fear are __s1__ talking about ? s2 is talking about people that love each other and want to tie the knot . how could that possibly strike fear in somebody ? please ... . yes , that 's true . yes , that 's true . are s2 saying love is the pattern ? well , love applies to straight marriages as well as gay marriages . love is not exclusive to gay marriages . if that 's the connection , we can just as easily say straight marriage will lead to incestuous marriage and polygamy . s2 are saying love will cause a slippery slope . it 's still __fallacious__ . the issue __s1__ brought up was why this __fallacy__ is often used , that is to create fear , because incest and polygamy are indeed considered so taboo . the issue is not the __tabooness__ of anything and everything , but how it is being used to distract from the issue of same-sex marriage , when there is n't a logical , rational argument against same-sex marriage . it 's an indication of desperation on the part of some of those who are against same-sex marriage . __s1__ have no reason to discuss the level of __acceptability__ or lack thereof of every single thing , before __s1__ accept one thing that is different from all those other things . __s1__ can deal with that one thing on all of its own merits and shortfalls , without being drawn into a false dilemma , either accept everything or else do n't accept one thing , as if those are the only two choices , __fallacy__ . gay marriage will change the definition of marriage from '' a legal union between a man and a woman '' to '' a legal union between any parties that love each other '' . if its ok for 2 people that love each other and want to tie the knot , then how could incest be a taboo ? based on what ? again with the double standard . gay marriage was considered just as much a taboo as incest or polygamy just a few years ago . being gay emerged from its taboo status through parades , promotional efforts , and , unfortunately , by spreading lies -lrb- i 'll deal with that in another thread -rrb- . however , incestuous people __didnt__ go through the process of parading their lifestyle in front of the world and practically begging for approval from society . so incest is still deeper in taboo status than homosexuality . why is it ok to deny incestuous relations the right to marry on the grounds that it is considered taboo , but ok to approve gay marriage on the same grounds ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are debating whether making gay marriage legal will open opportunities for other `` taboos '' in our society . __s1__ believes that in opening this opportunity for gay marriage , the definition of marriage will change and it will allow other issues like incest and polygamy to become legal . s2 accuses __s1__ of __hypocracy__ . in a sense , they believe gay marriage will have a sort of domino effect for other issues . __s1__ is arguing that using these other issues to be evidence for why !!__gay-marriage__!! should n't be allowed is not a valid argument . then __s1__ goes on to say that this tactic is used to instill fear to those who do not support those other issues . __s1__ understands the other issues , but does n't see the relationship between those and that of same-sex marriage . s2 keeps arguing that it __shouldnt__ be different figuring out whether one can approve gay marriage but not incest since they believe the two to be somewhat related .
generated -> prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . marriage is that now , and prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . it has everything to do with the slippery slope logical fallacy , which we have discussed in the forum ad nauseum .

Article ->  matt , this is getting ridiculous . s2 made an assertion that republicans would send gays to concentration camps like the germans did in the holocaust . then s2 brought up a statement by paul cameron , as if paul cameron has anything to do whatsoever with republican politics or leadership . now if s2 had linked someone in the republican leadership saying those things , s2 might have something , but s2 did n't . paul cameron is a psychologist that has gone over the top at times with some of the things he 's said about gays and has paid a price for it . he 's a frequent target of the gay pride movement for __demonization__ and because he did n't tow the line with the apa 's political stances , they distanced themselves from him . __s1__ do n't agree with everything he says either , for that matter . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking ; the most s2 can say is that they are paul cameron talking . well , sure -- anything could happen . a military coup could take place and we had have martial law . a new ice age could start in the next year . an asteroid could be on its way to hit earth . but there 's a big difference between possibility and likelihood . paul cameron is the single most frequently quoted '' expert '' cited by the gop in all their attempts to limit the rights of gay people . his '' research '' has been entered in the congressional record countless times . it really is astounding that anyone would have anything to do with him . including you . what price ? without his revolting beliefs and __star-power__ , he had be flipping burgers somewhere . instead , he 's raking in a fortune speaking to the '' moral '' groups __s1__ are constantly defending . he was dismissed from the group for conducting fraudulent research . cameron talking ... gop repeating . seriously , __jyoshu__ , the man called for extermination . how can __s1__ support him or cite him or defend him at all __??????__ how can s2 not stay on point ? unless cameron is a part of the gop __leadeship__ , matt is pulling some wild point out of his hat , saying that because someone who may not even be a republican hates gays , that republicans hate gays . __s1__ might as well have said that since john lennon attacked religion , then democrats hate religion . yes , his comments are that ludicrous . this is not about paul cameron no matter how much s2 had love to change the subject , it 's about matt 's ridiculous __generalizations__ and comments . oh , and s2 need to get up with the times -- no national political party has used cameron 's information in a serious way in a long time . __s1__ is sure you 'll now be googling to try and find republican individuals out there on the internet citing cameron , but that 's not the party leadership or its platform . there is no republican in leadership that would call for the extermination of gays , and s2 know it . nor does the platform say so . so let 's put that little lie to bed right now . sorry , sir . since __s1__ did n't stay on point , s2 thought others were just as free to wander . if democratic legislators from sea to shining sea quoted lennon 's lyrics about '' imagine no religion '' at every session that talked about religious freedom , __s1__ might draw that conclusion , no ? __ooops__ . s2 thought it was about a conservative democrat in minnesota bragging about '' inside information '' from that state 's supreme court . uh ... how about the president of the united states ??? paul cameron 's research is cited in virtually every single attack on gay people in state after state after state legislature . it was presented in the '' debate '' about same-sex marriage in the u.s. __friggin__ ' senate . his name appears in the citations of virtually every legal brief filed by opponents of same-sex marriage . __http__ think he even made it into lawrence v. texas . the man is president of the family research institute . he can probably phone up ol ' __dubya__ anytime he gets the urge . and __dubya__ will put down his pretzel and pick up the phone . what should be put to bed is paul cameron and every single bogus study related to him . that supposedly reasonable people would even mention his name is surprising . ok , __s1__ now realize something __s1__ did n't earlier -- that __http__ are obviously a dnc __shill__ . no one else would make such a ridiculous __generalization__ . __http__ really do think that 's all conservatives talk about , huh ? __s1__ hate to bust __http__ 's bubble , but it 's not . __s1__ know __http__ 's martyr complex is important to you , but it 's just not accurate . -lrb- shrug -rrb- what are __s1__ talking about ? s2 said __s1__ had probably be right to assume that some people were __anti-religion__ if they consistently talked about what a wonderful world it would be without it ? over and over . at every opportunity . and never had a single nice word to say about it . ever . __s1__ really are laughable when __s1__ try to defend the gop when one of their admittedly most effective propaganda campaigns is to rally the '' __family-values__ '' crowd against gay rights . it 's openly admitted by them . they are proud of their tactics . very odd ...
ref_sum ->  this seems to be an argument about gay rights and !!__generalizing__!! the political beliefs of people . according to __s1__ , s2 talks about paul cameron and makes it seem as if he is the voice of the republicans . __s1__ argues that it is not the case and one person who sides with a specific party does n't represent the party . __s1__ uses john lennon as an example of this not being a proper way to !!__generalize__!! political views of parties , in his case the democratic party . __s1__ accuses s2 of making an assertion including the republicans creating another holocaust , because of the !!__generalization__!! that s2 made . s2 believes that paul cameron 's views are cited and used in many cases against gay rights because most people do share the same views , which __s1__ thinks otherwise . s2 says that most attacks on gay rights have cited paul cameron , even within the us senate , showing that he has a strong opinion in the republican party , or at least it seems so .
generated -> is a psychologist that has gone over the top at times with some of the things he 's said about gays and has paid a price for that matter . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking ; the most s2 can say is that they are paul cameron talking . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking ; the most s2 can say is that they are paul cameron talking . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking .

ref_sum ->  this debate is about the 9th and how the federal constitution applies to marriage . __s1__ and s2 begin by talking about trolling and potentially starting a new debate on abortion , which does n't really have a lot of purpose in this conversation . s2 says that in saying people who want to get rid of gay marriage may have wanted to prevent __inter-racial__ and inter religious marriage . s2 states that maine 's vote on gay marriage was an opinion on gay marriage , rather than the 9th being how the federal constitution applies to gay marriage . s2 also says that bowers justice stevens does n't have the evidence to withstand his analysis . they also bring up lawrence v. texas and s2 states that even when majority wants a law it is n't enough for the constitution challenge of the law . s2 goes back to saying how __s1__ 's arguments are flawed and that its too repetitive for this conversation , because __s1__ has n't disproved anything . they go back to talking trash to each other and they end the conversation .

Article ->  s2 do know that the gay marriage debate is not synonymous with someone condoning violence against gays , right ? __s1__ seriously doubt anyone here does n't agree with s2 that gays should n't experience violence and name-calling , so that 's not even an issue on the table here . disagree and debate those who believe gay marriage is wrong all s2 want . but do n't dishonestly use arguments about violence , because no one here has argued for that . s2 is sorry , but have __s1__ read archie 's posts ??? he regularly __denigrates__ gays with a variety of slurs . and palin never asked for somebody to threaten obama either . but her rhetoric inflamed people to extremes that are grotesque . oh please . do n't start that subjective __canard__ again . if every religious person who genuinely disagreed with gay marriage because of their religion added a ' __but-no-violence__ ! ' __addendum__ to __everytime__ they weighed in on it , do s2 think anyone actually thinks s2 had be satisfied ? um ... no . it 's funny how the whole violence thing gets used as a __means-to-an-end__ tool by those who argue against religious people on this . well , it would be funny if it were n't sad to some extent . people should n't have to stop standing up for their principles just because of __nutcases__ out there . if the shoe fits ... s2 is talking about the people who proclaim abusive lies about gays . people who put out junk that makes people feel threatened by gays . telling people that gay marriage will makes their kids have to be taught about gay marriage ? that 's a threat . telling people that gay marriage will require churches to have to perform gay marriages ? that 's perceived as a threat too . s2 have no doubt that some people can discuss the subject without inciting . but on the prop 8 battle , the ads clearly were __inciteful__ . do __s1__ think that if a person talks about an abortion doctor '' killing babies '' , that does n't push somebody to think about claiming '' self-defense '' or '' defense of others '' ? how many people do __s1__ think are out there that have attacked a gay person that actually had somebody tell them '' s2 think __s1__ should go out and kill a gay person '' ? it 's built up toxicity from all the anti-gay rhetoric that reaches a boiling point . when the rhetoric __inflames__ , it 's obvious where it starts when somebody gets burned ... oh . and can s2 just say that while s2 am impressed __s1__ did n't try to attack me , __s1__ are doing a bad job of ignoring me ... yeah , when it fits . not other contexts . jason did n't make that distinction which is why __s1__ took issue with him on it . __s1__ did n't say __s1__ was going to start ignoring you , __foundit__ . __s1__ made clear __s1__ was done with that discussion . __s1__ did not say __s1__ was going to stop responding to s2 __foundit__ . and regarding s2 's comment about ' attacking ' , it 's because s2 's tone has changed in the last few posts -- s2 have turned off the hostility some , for __whatver__ reason , and it 's the nature of things that honey draws less flies than **** . that 's why s2 no longer perceive as being '' attacked . '' quite simply , s2 require a __fight-fire-with-fire__ approach , and so tone s2 are treated with -lrb- from me , anyway -rrb- depends entirely on you . and considering he was responding to archie , one of the guys who has got the worst track record on this message board for abusive slurs towards gays , s2 think he was right on track . oh . silly me . so that was just a lame attempt to dodge that conversation then . the one where s2 had just finished explaining how __s1__ were moving the __goal-posts__ and __obfuscating__ up a storm . s2 guess '' __clafclo__ '' was more successful than s2 thought . it 's amusing to watch __s1__ turn on __s1__ 's __passive-aggressive__ claims , and then turn them off again . when __s1__ need it as an excuse , you 'll start whining about '' attacks '' again , even as __s1__ drop claims that s2 should n't be a moderator of any board ... which s2 is sure is n't an '' attack '' or '' personal information '' in __s1__ 's book , hmmm ? and also , __s1__ 's response here is doing exactly what s2 noted on the other thread . __s1__ are dropping the majority of the topical text , and making more of an interest in that one __side-note__ comment ... __s1__ said __namecalling__ and violence , __foundit__ . those were the things jason __conflated__ with opposing gay marriage . once again s2 are being disingenuous again -- respond to what __s1__ actually said for once . show where archie has ever called gays names before , like the f word , or called for violence against gays . if s2 can , i 'll be glad to retract the comment . __namecalling__ and violence are wrong , regardless of where people fall on the issue of gay marriage . in fact , more importantly , they are always wrong no matter what the issue . whatever s2 want to think , __foundit__ . it 's not worth arguing over with a brick wall . __geeez__ __foundit__ . __s1__ suspect personal comments about posters are starting to compete or even outnumber pertinent points about issues s2 are making at this point . __s1__ think __s1__ is going to start using an __acronymn__ whenever s2 do so , that says personal comments & attacks do n't deal with issues . '' __pcaddwi__ '' . that way it will be noted when s2 do it , but it allow s2 to continue dragging down the thread with them . -lrb- or at least you 'll be completely alone in doing so . -rrb- __pcaddwi__ . quote him . quote exactly what he said . cause jason did no such thing ... were __s1__ looking in the mirror when __s1__ said that ? are __s1__ for real ? we have already got archie 's '' __bitchy__ as a gay '' comment . s2 never said he called gays '' __xxxxxx__ '' before . but ai n't it interesting how this board will sensor __######__ or __####__ , but if __s1__ say __xxxxxx__ , it 's __a-ok__ ... the fact that __s1__ argue with me on so many issues , but then throw this arbitrary argument out there , __belittles__ __s1__ 's claim and demonstrates an ulterior motive for ignoring the statement . are __s1__ going to label __s1__ 's own statements as such __jyoshu__ ? cause __s1__ have this boring habit of starting __passive-aggressive__ attacks , belittling other people , and then when somebody calls __s1__ on it or says something about it __s1__ eventually drop it and act surprised when other people point out __s1__ dropped it .
ref_sum ->  this is about the use of arguments of violence towards !!__gay-marriage__!! . __s1__ starts off saying there is a difference between being anti-gay and someone condoning violence against gay people . s2 talks about how violence is used to make people feel threatened to feel a certain way about a topic or debate . s2 used the example of kids being taught about gay marriage in school as a threat . s2 also mentions someone named archie who posts include a variety of slurs towards gay people . __s1__ brushes on the topic , but goes off track from the topic quite a bit . these two people start referring to each others `` attacks '' on each other towards the end . __s1__ says they were referring to !!__namecalling__!! and violence from the original post that was opposing gay rights . these two are n't really in opposite !!__positions/beliefs__!! , but they are more trying to discuss the ways they argue for or against gay marriage and how it may be portrayed by others .

Article ->  any two adults can run the household , one can make the decision if the other is incapacitated , one inherits when the other dies , etc etc. . that parallel does not carry over to group marriages . when one dies , who inherits ? if one is __incapacitied__ , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two , so __recongnising__ group marriages is a huge legal task , and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious . if we are talking about legal recognition , and we are -lrb- right ? -rrb- , then the cases are wildly different . our marriage laws , for better or worse , are set up on the assumption of two adults running a household . they also assume man and wife , true , but do n't actually depend on that . but the dependence on there being two people is embedded in the laws ; changing that is a huge project . yes , but gays would also want laws changed to __accomodate__ their form of marriage as well . the fact that one requires less change than the other should n't matter , should it ? should having to do more __reworking__ of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality ? it seems to me __s1__ 's argument boils down to '' polygamy requires more work to make the laws __accomodate__ it . '' yeah -- such is the price for marriage equality . let 's face it -- if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for __opposite-sex__ couples which comprise most relationships , they could pull it off -- polygamy , gays , letting 17 year olds marry , etc. . all those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed . means could be set up to determine inheritance , for example . laws can be worded to do it . see , this is why we try to avoid this debate . those who oppose gay marriage inevitably put their own spin on it and drag it to silly conclusion . here we see what gays really want turned into '' make marriage an open-ended institution of equality '' , which then means gay , poly , and 17 year olds in this case . __jyoshu__ stopped there , but it 's not uncommon for it then to go to children , cousins , dogs , whatever . this issue is not '' let 's let everyone do anything they like '' , that 's just the common __reframing__ we see whenever poly relations are brought up while __disscusing__ gay marriage . it happens all the time , it gets old , and that 's why people who have gone through it a bunch of times tend to __aviod__ the whole thing . it happens because there 's no way to avoid logical conclusions . believe it or not , cultural and legal precedent is a very real thing . the events in the article __exemplify__ this . if __s1__ argue to broaden marriage -lrb- which __s1__ are -rrb- , then this is what __s1__ have to deal with . as __s1__ said , s2 did stop with polygamy , gay , and barely lowering the age of consent , so why are you bringing up all the other examples like '' children , cousins dogs , '' or whatever , as if __s1__ were ready to pounce on that ? __s1__ are arguing against degrees that s2 did n't even say , or that no one said . now , do __s1__ have any response to s2 's point that __s1__ 's argument boils down to nothing more than '' polygamy requires more work to make the laws __accomodate__ it '' , or are __s1__ just going to avoid it by getting __sidetracked__ by the fact __s1__ do n't like that we are even talking about this ? again , society can deal with issues like polygamy if they really want to . sure there is . s2 can start with an erroneous assumption , like s2 did , and then arrive at an illogical conclusion , like s2 did . why do n't s2 read the exchanges between me and phyllis ; __s1__ think most of s2 's issues will be addressed that way . do __s1__ feel that opening marriage to gay couples is not a case of broadening marriage ? how is that an erroneous assumption ? sure , but s2 asked __s1__ some specific questions that __s1__ seem to be avoiding . in __s1__ 's exchange with phyllis s2 may comment on matters s2 disagree with . listen to yourself ! we start with '' gays want to get married '' , s2 change it to '' make marriage an open-ended institution of equality '' , and now s2 __segue__ over to '' broadening marriage '' . s2 's erroneous assumption is s2 's statement of what gays are trying to accomplish . until s2 stop trying to change what gays really want into something that s2 can argue against more easily all s2 's arguments will be based on erroneous assumptions . actually , __s1__ did address them . while debating with phyllis . naturally . and naturally __s1__ may ignore them if __s1__ think they are diversions . what gays are trying or not trying -lrb- in terms of intent -rrb- is not the issue . what is the crux here is that marriage would be broadened . it 's not rocket science . __s1__ are moving the boundaries of what constitutes a marriage to include more than __opposite-sex__ couples . very straightforward . s2 know __s1__ do n't like it __phrased__ that way , but that 's what it is . __s1__ ca n't take a phrase like ' gays want to get married '' without looking at the overall implications . in terms of legal rights , s2 do n't see why it would be any different . equality in marriage is equality in marriage regardless of the cultural motivation -- religious , being in love with more than one person , or simply just for the hell of it . for that matter , the argument could be made that __opposite-sex__ marriage between 2 people is largely a religious construct ! i 'll try to explain this to s2 one more time . the stated purpose of gays is quite __relevent__ if s2 are trying to argue against it . gays want to get married . one side effect of that is that some people will see the scope of marriage broadened . gays are not , in and of itself , trying to broaden marriage . they did not wake up one day and say '' let 's try to broaden the scope of marriage today , that 'll be fun ! '' s2 's arguments run along the lines of '' if s2 want to __braoden__ marriage , than s2 must __excpet__ it broadening in all these other ways '' and that 's why s2 's __rephrasing__ does n't work . broadening marriage is n't the goal , it 's a side effect , and since it is n't the goal we do n't have to accept all these other things s2 claim would be the result if they were trying to broaden marriage . to recap , s2 's arguments are based on s2 's assumption that gays want to broaden marriage , that that is their __ulitmate__ goal , the pinnacle of the cause . gays getting married to s2 seems to be the means to that end . that is , of course , backwards , and so s2 's __sematic__ based arguments fail . __kronos__ , s2 just told __s1__ s2 am not dealing here with what gays are trying / not trying to do in terms of intent , yet __s1__ are are arguing as if s2 never even said that . s2 am not arguing what gays have as intent . s2 completely understand what __s1__ are saying . s2 's point here is based on the effect of their intents , whatever that intent is . there is simply no way to get around the fact that if __s1__ change marriage to include other that __opposite-sex__ couples -lrb- to any number of other possibilities -- even one -rrb- , __s1__ are broadening marriage . whether or not gays set out out to do this in terms of a goal is irrelevant . __s1__ are attacking some point about intent that s2 have n't made -- s2 is talking about the effect here . to latch onto some straw man of '' intent '' is to completely miss the point . __s1__ is not ignoring this post , __s1__ is simply choosing not to respond because it 's a pointless distraction in an otherwise __interesing__ thread . if s2 want to start another thread on this theme i 'll explain there how wrong s2 are . well , __s1__ are the one that 's taking issue and making it a distraction !
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : !!__opposers__!! to gay marriage often jump to conclusions about who can get married - why not cousins , group marriages , children , dogs ? polygamous marriage raises legal concerns that are not currently covered in traditional marriage laws , for example . the goal of gay marriage supporters is to be able to get married - not to broaden marriage . broadened marriage is a side effect of legal gay marriage . s2 : gay marriage supporters want marriage laws changed to accommodate gay marriage . broadened marriage could change the current traditional marriage laws . polygamy , for example , would require more marriage laws changed than gay marriage would , as more people are involved . but if enough people wanted legal polygamous marriage , the laws would be passed . marriage would be broadened if gay marriage is made legal , whether that is the goal of gay marriage or not .
generated -> if one is incapacitied , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that parallel does not carry over to group marriages . if one is incapacitied , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two , so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task , and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious that

Article ->  do n't __s1__ think that in 1909 it was probably viewed mostly from a moral standpoint ? __s1__ do n't think they saw it the same way they would see black people . they did n't even realize that ' homosexuality ' was any sort of innate thing . it was entirely behavioral to them . __s1__ tend to agree with the court , even given what __s1__ have said . __s1__ doubt for 1909 it was about prejudice and bigotry -- they genuinely felt it was wrong . the concept of gay marriage was completely foreign and unknown in 1909 . it was n't even something they conceived of . __s1__ think the court is saying that they could n't have been prejudiced against something they did n't even know of or conceive of . __hogwash__ . it was once entirely moral to believe certain races were inferior , and that women had fewer rights than men . treating the races and women as equal was not something even thought of by many . it was prejudice against gays then , and it still is today . this is not really true . it 's a popular __misconstruing__ of morality and history by proponents of modern ' rights ' movements , but it 's not true . there 's little historical backing to the idea that people believed __oppressing__ black people was a right thing to do , as in , doing good . there were times they used an argument where religion was wrongly used to justify their behavior , but that 's a different matter . if s2 firmly believe otherwise , __s1__ had challenge s2 to show where people thought __oppressing__ blacks was an example if doing good . the same goes for misogyny . furthermore , it 's beside the point anyway . we are talking about homosexuality . in 1909 , the only thing they really understood about the issue at hand was that some people engaged in sexual relations with people of their own gender . there were no articles about '' homosexuality '' as a trait , and certainly none about genetic causes . it was understood entirely from a behavioral standpoint , and therefore a moral standpoint . so it 's not __hogwash__ at all -- they really did view gay sex as immoral . if s2 do n't think so , then s2 have a very poor grasp on history in this case . this kind of morality is based on nothing but ignorance -lrb- which __s1__ admit -rrb- and prejudice . what kind of a basis is that for a so-called moral code ? so what if it involves behaviour ? gay people have sex , develop relationships , and bond , just like everyone else , but in a way that reflects their gay sexuality . this does not mean people could not be prejudiced about the way gay people live . people were , and are so prejudiced . a better reverse analogy would have been to say '' so then __conversly__ __s1__ have the right to advocate that heterosexual relations are morally wrong '' . not __heterosexuality__ , since it 's not homosexuality -lrb- as it 's a state of being -rrb- that religious people have a problem with . heck , they often do n't even recognize it . with that caveat , yes s2 are certainly free to advocate whatever s2 want to be morally wrong . -lrb- and unlike the way some in s2 's movement do , __s1__ wo n't call s2 a '' bigot '' for doing so ! -rrb- it may have been based on '' ignorance '' , but __s1__ reject the notion it was based on prejudice -lrb- and therefore __s1__ tend to agree with the 6 - 0 view of the justices here -rrb- . the 1909 society had too little understanding of gay people to be prejudiced over in the first place . remember , homosexuality was not understood as a state of being at that time . the term itself had not been around long and was not known to most people . and even to those it was known to , it was not known as a state of being . and there certainly was no social identity among gay people as a group -- how could prejudice have existed if there was nothing -lrb- from their perspective -rrb- to be prejudiced toward ? right . provided gays do n't live gay , but live straight , gays can be as gay as they want . as long as gays do n't outwardly show what makes them different from __straights__ , gays can be as gay as they want . it 's bs . also some may not recognize the existence of gay people or their gay lives , but that is putting one 's head in the sand . nonsense . people would widely and __hatefully__ use the term '' __sodomite__ '' to refer to gays . before that the term was '' molly '' . clearly there was an identity they were prejudiced towards . they were rounding up gays in areas they were known to attend , and putting them in prison . read up on the trial of oscar wilde . gays may have been forced underground , to a greater extent , but that does not mean they were not thought of . gays were just not thought of in a nice way . gays were purposely kept out of everything in society , when society did n't really think of gays as human too . that is n't prejudice ? because they did n't approve of sodomy ! do s2 not agree they did n't understand the concept of homosexuality ??? there was no social identity . when they were put on trial , it was n't because they were gay -lrb- which they had no concept of -rrb- , it was because they had gay relations which society viewed as wrong ! no , here 's where s2 do n't get it -- it 's not that '' gays '' -lrb- there was no concept of that -rrb- were purposely kept out of of everything , it 's that people who had sodomy relationships were kept out of everything , because sodomy was viewed as wrong . they really did think it was wrong ! s2 are so determined to portray everything that has anything to do with gay relations possibly being wrong as prejudice and bigotry that s2 are __close-minded__ about it .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : in 1909 , being homosexual was morally wrong , and people could be prejudiced about something that they did not recognize as innate . there was little historical evidence to prove that people in 1909 believed that it was `` right '' or `` good '' to !!__oppress__!! black people or women , and this sentiment extend to homosexuals . in 1909 , people knew that gay sex occurred and they understood its occurrence to be entirely behavioral , and therefore , immoral . homosexuality was not understood as a social identity back then , so there was no `` gay lifestyle '' to be prejudiced against . sodomy was criminalized , not being gay . s2 : there was prejudice against gays in 1909 just as there is now . the !!__immorality__!! of homosexuality in 1909 is based on ignorance . as long as gay people `` lived straight '' , they could be as sexually !!__non-normative__!! as they wanted to be . there were terms for gay men back then , like !!__sodomite__!! and molly , so there was a clear identity for people to be prejudiced against . men who `` acted gay '' were punished for it in 1909 .

ref_sum ->  __s1__ : religion is a good tool to guide one 's own actions , but not for telling others how to live . people have been prejudiced against homosexuals for a long time . moral or religious prejudice is still prejudice . a person can claim a moral or religious stance without having one . you can not justify an anti-gay agenda on morals or religion . an anti-gay stance on the grounds of religious belief is prejudice . prejudice based on religious belief implies that a religious person 's acts of prejudice could have a negative impact on homosexuals , because they believe that being gay is morally reprehensible . s2 : prejudice is a fact of human existence . christianity is a moral system . when people claim religion in morals , they abandon that moral system . it is religious belief - not prejudice - that makes one take an anti-gay stance . the bible says that homosexuality is wrong , so if you believe in the bible as your moral canon , then you believe that homosexuality is wrong as well .

Article ->  new england and new york will probably have gay marriage within the next few years . the west coast might also follow suit after that . __s1__ think the recent wave of gay marriage legalization will stop for the next 20 years or so after that . 30 states already define marriage as between a man and a woman . do n't be so sure . if congress removes doma and with roberts and alito on the court same sex marriage will come to the rest of the country with a 7 to 2 ruling . roberts and alito are constitutional __literalists__ and with doma out of the way the full faith and credit clause is a clear constitutional mandate . can s2 demonstrate evidence that the __scotus__ would nullify gay marriage bans in all states ? if the __scotus__ was so imposed , why do n't they just strike doma down right now and then declare all gay marriage bans unconstitutional ? secondly , states can choose not to recognize gay marriage even without federal doma . there is a choice of law doctrine that allows states to not recognize other states marriages that they find '' offensive '' to their own public policy . states have been not recognizing each others marriages for decades and states do not use the __ffc__ clause to make one state recognize another 's marriage . there is no case history of __ffc__ ever used in this way . even in cases where it has been attempted , the legal argument involved is so lengthy , that it effectively prohibits __ffc__ use due to the sheer amount of hassle and legal proceedings involved in winning such a case . it is called the constitution of the united states a marriage license is a public act and record which __http__ are obviously ignorant of . __http__ completely failed to respond to the choice of law doctrine , as well as __s1__ 's request that __http__ provide justification on __http__ 's claims of how each justice would vote , as well as __s1__ 's challenge to __http__ to explain why doma has not been declared unconstitutional if __http__ 's claims about the justices were true . apparently , the law is beyond __http__ 's comprehension , as is __http__ 's ability to consider facts in forming __http__ 's opinions . in answer to __s1__ 's question . steven , kennedy , souter , ginsburg , and breyer will side with us . roberts and alito will follow the constitution as written . scalia and thomas are a lost anti gay cause . that is how s2 know how they will vote . as to why doma has not been declared unconstitutional is because there has not been a case in the courts challenging doma and so has not been taken up by __scotus__ . i 'll do a little research on s2 's claims . regardless , s2 still failed to address how state courts may use the choice of law doctrine so that the __ffc__ clause does not apply , and if it were , the sheer complication of applying the law would make it effectively prohibitive . by all means , post up the __ffc__ clause again so s2 can avoid addressing this . s2 do not see how choice of law doctrine is not trumped by the full faith and credit clause in cases of marriage contract since there is a current tradition of one state respecting other states marriage licenses when it comes to __heteros__ . the choice of law doctrine is used to settle differences between different state laws . that is how the law is practiced , and that is what courts believe . again , states have been disagreeing on the validity of each other 's marriages for decades and there has been no case history of the full faith and credit clause that has made one state recognize another state 's marriage . courts look to the choice of law doctrine before the __ff__ & c c.
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : legally , it is complicated to legalize gay marriage in all states , as doma is in place and states have chosen not to recognize other state 's marriages for decades . attempts abide by the __ffc__ clause to in respect to marriage -lrb- even before doma -rrb- require such lengthy legal arguments that they are rendered prohibitive . the choice of law doctrine must be considered and doma could be found to be unconstitutional by vote of the __scotus__ . how will states use the choice of law doctrine so that the __ffc__ clause does not apply ? s2 : if congress removes doma , a vote for legal gay marriage will pass quickly , and certain justices of __scotus__ already approve of gay marriage . doma has yet to be declared unconstitutional because there has yet to be a case made to challenge doma in the courts , so it has not been decided upon by __scotus__ . the choice of law doctrine trumps the __ffc__ clause in cases of marriage contract and there is a current tradition of respecting other states marriage licenses for .

Article ->  withers dc council votes for gay marriage by james withers , contributing editor , 365 gay blog __12.15.2009__ pm est in a 11 - 2 vote , the city council of washington , dc voted for gay marriage . we are a bit __short-handed__ today , so expect more about this later . until then have a sip of the bubbly and congrats to the district . wait until it 's put on a ballot for the voters to decide . this is n't the first time that a liberal government did n't pay attention to the will of the people . and what is the will of the people jp ? people in support of marriage equality is steadily growing . compare the polls from ten years ago to now to see ... it is only a matter of time before equality stands upon the side of the majority . s2 keep hearing gays say that but every time it 's put to a vote , __s1__ lose . s2 had say that it 's time to try another tact because the current one is a losing proposition . the only thing forcing gay marriage on a population does is galvanize them against the forced action . and when they respond on the ballot , they do so __punatively__ . just wait until __s1__ see the repercussions of the current efforts to give all federal employee 's same sex partners __bennies__ on our dime despite doma . s2 is guessing that some additional democratic heads will roll in the fall election if that flies . __s1__ need a pr strategy that highlights the advantages of gay unions over __bathhouse__ and gay bar __existences__ . s2 believe that a true majority of people would support civil unions but not marriage . and s2 count myself amongst that majority . actually jp so far 5 states have passed gay marriage so no not every time it is put to a vote do we lose . and how am __s1__ forcing anyone to accept gay marriage ? am __s1__ forcing these voters to attend __s1__ 's wedding or dare __s1__ say be in a marriage themselves ? and __s1__ can not agree with s2 more about changing the image of the gay community as a whole . . we are not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people running around ... what __s1__ find funny is once strait people find out how boring we really are , and how we pay taxes just like every other joe __schmo__ they 'll think nothing more of special rights lol ... but actually like __s1__ stated earlier in another thread if those unions constituted the same legal rights as married couples __s1__ would be content . which 5 states put gay marriage on the ballot and it won ? to the best of s2 's knowledge , no state that has gay marriage today has ever gotten it via the ballot . it has either been the court or legislature that has forced it on the state . the gays s2 know are as boring as mr and mrs john q. public as well , but that 's not the image that is portrayed to the general public . like s2 said , __s1__ have a pr problem . s2 think that if more gays were willing to settle for civil unions that were more equivalent to marriage , __s1__ had have an easier time gaining legal acceptance . ok maybe not the ballot ... got me there man . lol ... . maine was a close one though . and yeah we got a major pr problem big time ... and __s1__ said as long as we got the legal rights of marriage and called it __cu__ __s1__ would be cool with that . __s1__ already wear a dress and heels enough as it is ! __lmao__ jk ... . s2 hope that you , at least , shave __s1__ 's legs . __;-rrb-__ oh __s1__ do ... __lmao__ __naw__ __s1__ do n't wear a dress __s1__ would n't look good in one ...
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : washington dc ' s city council recently legalized gay marriage . people 's support of gay marriage has been growing steadily in the past ten years , and will soon be the majority opinion . five states have already legalized gay marriage . those opposed to gay marriage may view gays as promiscuous and sexual !!__deviants__!! , but most gay men are !!__assuredly__!! quite normal . civil unions will not be accepted in place of marriage , as they do not allow the same legal rights as marriage . s2 : councils and legislatures may vote in favor of gay marriage , but it has yet to be the majority vote of the people . gay marriage should be played in a positive light by its supporters , because the current public perception of gay men is that they are promiscuous and lead a `` gay lifestyle '' that is offensive . anti-gay marriage supporters will support civil unions in lieu of gay marriage , and homosexuals should be satisfied with that .

Article ->  well ... so far eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue have found that barring same-sex marriage is unconstitutional . we are waiting to hear about three or four more . as for the nature of marriage , it is both a legal contract and -lrb- sometimes -rrb- a religious ceremony -lrb- sacrament in some religions -rrb- . we are stuck with the __duality__ , whether we like it or not , and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect . different religions can do what they want . they found that it violated their state __constitutions__ , right ? this has nothing to do with the us constitution . the winning arguments were based largely on state constitutional provisions that closely parallel , if not outright __mimmick__ , the federal constitution . that 's not generally true , is it ? for example , the massachusetts ruling was based on a specific provision in the mass. constitution that prohibits discrimination based on sexual preference . there 's nothing like that in the us constitution . and s2 's overall point was that we should be careful when calling something '' unconstitutional '' , in that we should be clear it we are talking state or federal constitution . many state __constitutions__ guarantee rights that are n't in the __fedral__ constitution . there 's nothing like that in the mass. . constitution either . though , it 's a __darned__ good idea ! goodrich was decided on equal protection grounds , citing the mass. document . __s1__ had have to look up the others to see the exact reasoning , but they are not likely to be far afield from the bedrock principles of equal protection and due process . gay rights is a real test of our constitutional system , and , so far , we are not passing with flying colors ... __s1__ are right , s2 __misremembered__ . it 's just __descrimination__ based on sex that 's banned .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing the issue of marriage equality . both subjects seem to be on the fence with the issue . __s1__ cites that eight of nine supreme courts have contended same sex marriage to be unconstitutional . s2 questions how gay marriage would violate someone 's constitutional rights . __s1__ advises the bulk of the arguments were based on state __constitutions__ which mirror the federal constitution . s2 uses the example of massachusetts ' allowing gay marriage under its state constitutional law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation . __s1__ contends there is no such piece to the massachusetts constitution . s2 then concedes he was incorrect about the citing and the law actually banned only discrimination based on gender and not sexual orientation .
generated -> marriage , it is both a legal contract and -lrb- sometimes -rrb- a religious ceremony -lrb- sacrament in some religions -rrb- , whether we like it or not , and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect . the winning arguments were based on state constitutional provisions that closely parallel , if not outright mimmick , the federal constitution .

Article ->  it would lead ultimately down the road to a marriage bill for __polygamists__ . that is why the current push for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage also contains a provision banning polygamous marriage as well . hmm ... . some opposition to the petition ... more left wing ideology at work . if the man after god s own heart had multiple wives , why can t i ? have heard others say that we already have polygamy in america . it s called serial polygamy because of our liberal divorce laws . so now those that are opposed to even more laws on the books and a return to old testament practices are considered left wing ? what s this world coming too ? lol king david having multiple wives was under old testament practice . jesus himself stated that divorce laws were granted by moses and allowed by god because of the __hardness__ of the people hearts . jesus said a man shall leave his father and mother and be __cleaved__ to his wife , not wives . __btw__ , its called serial __monogamy__ . if its ' right wing ' to support a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage than its ' left wing ' to oppose a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage . so is it a sin or just a practice ? s2 don t remember jesus saying polygamy was wrong . the statement __s1__ referred to does indicate that he was talking about a single wife , but s2 __wouldn__ t base a whole social convention on one word out of a whole book . anyway the jews don t believe in the new testament . would it be okay for them ? man s2 screwed that one up . s2 ll try to be a little more articulate in the future . okay was just wondering . base 's wing on what think is correct , not left or right . a few years ago it was right wing to be against the deficit , now it seems to be left wing . but that just shows what know about wings . lol the idea that it is now left wing to be against deficits is absurd . numerous democrats actually wanted to spend more than the bush administrations 12.5 % increase in federal spending . s2 was basing that on __s1__ 's previous statement in other words , anything that is opposed to one wing must be the opposite so s2 don t see how it s absurd unless __s1__ want to call __s1__ 's original statement absurd . this is obviously not the thread for this discussion but s2 will reply this time and see where it takes us . __s1__ __didn__ t state what __s1__ considered to be numerous nor did __s1__ supply anything to back up that statement . however deficits depend on both increased spending and lower revenues . bush has done both with large tax cuts and large discretionary spending increases . and even the conservatives are beginning to criticize him for being a big spending president . over the past 23 years , conservative administrations have increased the deficits and liberal administrations have decreased the deficits . so yeah it looks to me like left wing is against deficits and right wing is for deficits .
ref_sum ->  two people are debating the topic of gay marriage rights . __s1__ believes allowing gays to marry will open up the door to legalize other types of marriage such as polygamy . s2 holds to the theory that if king david was able to have multiple wives , why then should the common man not be able to , especially if religion is to now be the basis for all laws . __s1__ contends that practice was of the old testament and is no longer considered commonplace . s2 feels __s1__ is too left wing to entertain the thought of allowing gay marriage , but uses religion as the basis even though there are so many contradictions between the old testament and what is considered the new testament .
generated -> some opposition to the petition ... more left wing ideology at work . if the man after god s own heart had multiple wives , why can t i ? have heard others say that we already have polygamy in america that

ref_sum ->  __s1__ is against gay rights apparently because of the biblical story of __sodom__ , and the sexual activities __s1__ perceives to have occurred in san francisco bath houses , which __s1__ asserts the current gay community is trying to re-open . he argues that the gay community is going back to unprotected sex and that a daisy chain of 100 men perform unprotected sex on each other in the bath houses . s2 challenges the assumptions , specifically finding the daisy chain of 100 men a less than credible assertion and !!__admonishes__!! __s1__ to use facts to support his arguments , not opinions . s2 also notes that __s1__ 's apparent fascination with bath houses is not relevant to the gay rights topic under which the posts are being entered .

ref_sum ->  prior to this dialog , s2 apparently likened the gay marriage movement to the civil rights movement of the african american community . __s1__ is offended by the alleged analogy , finding a material distinction between race and sexual orientation . she suggests that to view it otherwise would be an insult to all african americans . s2 points out that two presumably prominent african american figures , !!__corretta__!! scott king and __jullian__ bond , are !!__pro-gay__!! marriage . __s1__ questions whether they do in fact support gay marriage , and s2 provides links to support his assertion . __s1__ accepts the evidence and concedes that some african americans may not be as insulted by the analogy and wonders how martin luther king felt about the issue of gay marriage .
generated -> yep , coretta scott king and jullian bond are against gay rights . s1 did say '' all african americans `` '' we are for gay marriage ? we are talking about gay marriage ``

Article ->  agreed , when the husband is part of a __hetero__ relationship . gay husband is not a legally recognized category . agreed , when the wife is part of a __hetero__ relationship . gay wife is not a legally recognized category . agreed , when the spouse is part of a __hetero__ relationship . gay spouse is not a legally recognized category . so the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem . what is the reason it 's not legally recognized ? because the couple is gay . where do __s1__ get the figure of 500,000 gay couples who want to immediately be married ? would these gay couples beat the straight couples in some kind of a race to the weddings occurring at the same time , or occurring over the course of a month or a year ? they are not legally recognized because they do n't meet the legal criteria for marriage , ie one man , one woman . a cat does n't meet the legal definition of a dog . do we change the definition of dog to appease the cat ? that 's the real question to be answered by society . actually , __s1__ pulled the number out of the air for __illustrative__ purposes only , but after reading the cbo report , __s1__ see that __s1__ was n't far off . they predicted 600,000 gay couples would want to get married it allowed . this is circular reasoning however . it 's stating that marriage simply is heterosexual , and so completely ends debate . exactly __s1__ 's point , just as a cat can never be considered a dog just because someone wants it to be . to me , and __s1__ is guessing millions of others , the term gay marriage is an __oxymoron__ . that 's not to say that we should n't consider the possibility of allowing gay unions with , possibly , equivalent rights to __hetero__ couples if we , as a society , see the benefit in doing so . for example , prior to fdr , the concept of state welfare was considered ludicrous and unconstitutional , but he was able to get enough support -lrb- and enough political muscle -rrb- to change society 's mind on the role of the federal gov ' t once he demonstrated the '' good '' that doing so had on america in its most dire time of need . people were willing to sacrifice a little freedom for security just as ben franklin had warned against . now , i 'll be the first to tell s2 that __s1__ think fdr was the biggest threat to american freedom that ever existed , but one ca n't argue his ability to change public opinion on the role of the federal gov ` t . it concerns reason , as __jaxian__ said earlier . what are the logical reasons for marriage discrimination against gays and lesbians ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ does not believe that anyone outside of a heterosexual marriage should be considered a husband , wife or a spouse because legally they are not . this person believes that the term gay marriage is an __oxymoron__ because marriage , legally , to them , is only between one man and one woman . they believe that prior to roosevelt , society did not accept the idea of state welfare as constitutional , but because people were willing to sacrifice freedom for security , they eventually caved to his ideas . s2 does not believe that marriage is simply between one man and one woman , and that the entire reason behind the debate is so that homosexual marriage can and will be legally recognized . they do not see a reason for discrimination against homosexual marriage .
generated -> s1 pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only , but after reading the cbo report , s1 see that s1 was n't far off . it 's stating that marriage simply is heterosexual , and so completely ends debate that

ref_sum ->  __s1__ does not believe that most christians are trying to ban homosexual unions , and that those accusing them of doing so are doing so falsely . they believe that homosexual lobbyists have gone beyond being defensive and are actively attempting to attack evangelical !!__christiandom__!! falsely in order to justify their arguments . s2 believes that the majority of __self-identified__ christians in the united states in fact , do oppose civil unions for homosexual citizens . however , they point out that in other countries such as spain , they might not , but in general , the belief is the same globally . they refute __s1__ 's claims that they are not trying to ban homosexual unions by pointing out that the state constitutional amendments being passed are intended to preclude same-sex marriage and civil unions .

Article ->  yet s2 still will not answer the question . how does equal marriage hurt her or any heterosexual ? if she has her way __s1__ am the one that is hurt . __s1__ 's way of equal marriage __s1__ am not hurt nor is she . yes s2 did , in this post . s2 __summarize__ so what if a proposed law '' hurts '' you ? there are all kinds of laws that '' hurt '' all kinds of people . but is glad to see that s2 abandoned s2 's silly argument that it would be a violation of the first amendment to enact her religious belief about marriage , but not a violation of the first amendment to enact your religious belief about marriage . now , if s2 could only justify why only laws which do not cause '' harm '' to others are allowed to be enacted . frankly am astounded by s2 's affinity for the '' harm principle '' when s2 say things like '' do n't know about the '' culture war '' but am at war with evangelical anti gay christianity . will do whatever it takes to knock then down . '' because __s1__ am only concerned with rights of gay people . gay people are __s1__ 's first concern . this evil woman should come out and __sayshe__ is anti gay . she should come out and say she does n't want gay people to get married . she should admit that she wants gay people to remain second class citizens . why does n't she own up to her discrimination ? she wants to protect her heterosexual __privledge__ . for the record __s1__ own that statement and stand behind it . __s1__ will talk people out of attending these bible churches . __s1__ will do what __s1__ can to legally disrupt any __rundrasining__ activities they have going . __s1__ will protest their wedding ceremonies . __s1__ will protest their church services . as far as __s1__ am concerned , once they crossed over the line and started pushing for and getting laws enacted that hurt me , __s1__ 's family , __ands__ __s1__ 's people , they have no place in society . and __s1__ have yet to show why this is not a legitimate viewpoint , nor a legitimate way to legislate this issue . it 's obvious that all __s1__ care about is gay people . however , __s1__ have not shown why anti-gay -lrb- as __s1__ call them -rrb- people should not be able to legislate their view . all __s1__ have said is that __s1__ do n't like their view . big deal , they do n't like __s1__ 's view either . thus , in a democracy like ours , the majority of people decide issues like this . besides that , s2 think coming out in support of a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage qualifies as '' com -lsb- ing -rsb- out and say -lsb- ing -rsb- that she does n't want gay people to get married . '' this is fine . but also understand that it is legitimate for people who believe like ms. __musgrave__ to do the same , including to use the democratic process to have her view enacted in law . if __s1__ are free to do it , then she is as well . should the majority have the right to __enslave__ their fellow citizens ? should the majority have the right to lock people up in concentration camps ? a majority of the people in the us once thought it was a good idea . oh __s1__ want the evil woman to say it . __s1__ want her __viciousness__ and ugliness out in the open . if she is anti gay then she needs to own up to her bigotry repent america believes in protesting and disrupting gay gatherings . why if they can do this __s1__ can do the same . the majority did have the legal right -lrb- unfortunately -rrb- to __enslave__ their fellow citizens until the 13 th amendment took that option off the table . incidentally , it took a majority of people to take slavery off of the table . in the united states , the majority wins -lrb- for good or for ill -rrb- . s2 hope __s1__ are not trying to make a comparison between the denial of marriage to gays -lrb- and to 10 year olds , and to those who are currently married yet want another husband / wife , and to those who wish to marry their father , etc. -rrb- on the one hand , and slavery and / or concentration camps on the other . ok , and what would that accomplish ? yeah , that 's exactly what s2 said .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are talking about how democracy is based on majority rule and whether or not its fair . __s1__ believes it is completely unfair that gay marriage be dismissed or disliked and s2 argues that no matter what __s1__ believes is right or wrong , the majority of people control what is normal in our society . that if __s1__ is only towards the rights of gay people it is completely understandable for this lady to be in belief that marriage as is is fine . s2 believes that __s1__ 's argument is not a legitimate viewpoint because __s1__ has no justification that this lady hates gays . __s1__ believes that because this lady is not in favor of gay marriage , the lady is anti-gay . __s1__ is taking an aggressive approach by saying they will talk to bible churches and disrupt them because she feels like she has no place in society . __s1__ thinks that the majority of people is !!__enslaving__!! their people by not allowing gay rights , but s2 argues that it happens that way and it changes over time .

ref_sum ->  this is about gay marriage . __s1__ seems to believe that someone is making religion into law by saying marriage should be between a heterosexual couple . s2 is arguing that __s1__ 's point is not very valid because __s1__ is not understanding that they are not using the persons perspective . __s1__ believes that that person is trying to hurt them , while s2 is saying that the person may not necessarily be that way and that the person may be arguing for what they believe to be greater for society , based on their own perspective . __s1__ 's religious view of marriage is based on two people 's love for each other , while the other person believes its between a man and woman . s2 says __s1__ 's argument is empty and that __s1__ is not showing how the other person is being hurt by gay marriage . s2 thinks __s1__ is not understanding the overall perspectives and just focusing on their own needs . __s1__ states that the person 's religion put into law affects peoples ability to marry if they are gay , but that __s1__ 's religion on marriage put into law would not affect marriage for anyone .

Article ->  __lesz__ , __s1__ 's marriage means a great many things to me , none of which have anything to do with our governments . __s1__ 's question to s2 is what do __s1__ think marriage should mean to our governments ? well , marriage is an ancient human institution , based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans , and is one of the foundations of social stability . why would it surprise anyone that government might wish to support it ? what really surprises me is to find how many alleged christians now find it __expedient__ to demand government '' get out of marriage '' , simply because gay people want to get in it . bunch of hypocrites -- they never complained about government regulating marriage before this . now , while s2 agree it is n't absolutely essential for government to be involved in the regulation and support of marriage , it is nevertheless a convenience that few people would really want to throw away . -lrb- mr. __writela__ has summed it up eloquently so s2 need n't elaborate . -rrb- alas , many are just too mean-spirited to share marriage with those pesky __homos__ , so they have jumped on the __get-out-of-marriage__ bandwagon -- which is n't going to go anywhere -- as camouflage for their real feelings . that government would wish to be involved in any aspect of our lives , would not surprise me . that is what governments tend to do . consider the '' healthy marriage initiative '' . this is our government and as citizens , we would be well advised to exercise vigilance to prevent our government from __intruding__ into areas where there is no necessity . just because a few mean-spirited hypocrites may advocate that the government get out of marriage for the wrong reasons does not mean that the idea is all bad . never happen ? enlist the 100 single people who have the biggest stake in this issue and chip away at the exclusive benefits . start with an easy one like hospital visitation and work up to the tough ones like social security to spouses why ? why is it in the interests of society to prevent government involvement in marriage ? that 's what __s1__ have n't explained . __mrwritela__ pointed out the reasons that government involvement is pretty much unavoidable , if only because government is the source of law . it seems to me __s1__ advocate the replacement of marriage with a plethora of minor and specific legal contracts that would only benefit the lawyers writing them . it 's the wood and the trees . if specific laws are trees , then marriage is the forest that protects our relationships from such gales that xxxx . is there any specific advantage to looking to individual trees and ignoring the wood ? __lesz__ __s1__ ask why and s2 ask why not . why should government get out of the marriage business 1 . it is not needed 2 . the current marriage benefits are terribly unfair to single people that are forced to pay for them . __s1__ 's __eloquence__ notwithstanding , have found it useful to look very closely at the trees when solving problems . would suggest that one can not understand the wood unless one knows something about trees . also , have often found it useful to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller parts and solving the easiest parts first . why is government support of marriage unfair to single people ? single people do not have the same issues as married people . having been married and single myself , s2 do have some insight here . and why would rather married people go to lawyers for multiple legal contracts to cover all the hundreds of rights and mutual obligations currently conferred by marriage ? are a lawyer in need of clients ? __;-rrb-__ s2 's own experience of woods and trees is that there is no value in looking at them in only one way . one needs to consider them as trees and woods . __s1__ have also been single and married . experience but not much insight . __s1__ would be interested to hear s2 's views about this difference in issues and how these issues are helped by government involvement . __lesz__ , __s1__ am an engineer , not a lawyer . well , single people live by themselves , not as a family . by definition , they do not have a significant relationship -- and no , s2 do n't count boyfriends or girlfriends here , s2 am referring to committed couples who live together as a family unit . there are many legal issues such as inheritance , pension and social security rights , adoption and child custody , home ownership , etc. , which would need separate legal contracts without the umbrella of marriage . -lrb- and of course , even then such contracts would only be enforceable by government . -rrb- s2 myself had tremendous difficulties sorting out property issues with s2 's partner 's family after he died . it all but __bankrupted__ me , and there would n't have been any issue at all had it been legal for us to get married . we did have some legal contracts pertaining to the house , and wills , but alas they were n't good enough to get his family off s2 's back , because our legal relationship was trumped by his familial one . s2 am not saying it could n't be done piecemeal , tailor-made to suit each individual couple , but would n't that be excessively inconvenient -- for everyone but the lawyers ? whereas at __prresent__ , when __s1__ get married for a $ 25 license , hey presto , __s1__ get those protections and the lawyers have to defer their caribbean cruise .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are debating the topic of what marriage should mean to our government . __s1__ believes it is not a bad idea because they think it is not necessary for the government to be involved in most aspects of our lives , while s2 is questioning why it 's necessary to try and remove government involvement when it is unavoidable . __s1__ brings up that because several people are against the government due to gay marriage and not because it 's just marriage altogether , it does n't mean it 's not a bad idea to remove government intervention . __s1__ mentions the `` healthy marriage initiative '' and how it is n't necessary . s2 says that there is too much legal work and documents behind marriage in the government , such as inheritance , pension and social rights , etc. . , and that it would be a lot more work if the government did n't intervene , also stating that removing marriage from government will only benefit lawyers . both __s1__ and s2 have had experience with marriage , s2 states that marriage benefits are good because of government intervention .
generated -> marriage '' an ancient human institution , based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans , and is one of the foundations of social stability that alas , many are just too mean-spirited to share marriage with those pesky homos , so they have jumped on the get-out-of-marriage bandwagon . why is it in the interests of society to prevent government involvement in marriage ? that

Article ->  in the sense that saying one supports gay rights but not gay marriage , sure . but __s1__ have no problem with that inconsistency . however , s2 are for gay marriage , __ergo__ , it makes more sense s2 had be bothered by that inconsistency . but if not , fine . whatever ... -lrb- and yes , __s1__ know s2 have given me s2 's ' reasons ' . does n't mean there 's no inconsistency there . it just means s2 think it 's not something that should be challenged right now . -rrb- again , s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't understand why __s1__ keep saying it 's an '' inconsistency '' . it 's not a matter of it being a '' problem '' , but rather a question of why __s1__ repeatedly label it as an '' inconsistency '' . just to try to put this plainly . __s1__ and biden have both stated the same opinion . against gay marriage , but for gay rights in every other way . with __s1__ 's stated opinion statement , s2 do n't see an inconsistency . but __s1__ do see an inconsistency with __s1__ 's stated opinion statement . quite frankly , s2 really have n't seen __s1__ show an inconsistency yet . __s1__ have said '' inconsistency '' , but not show it . it 's a bit like saying '' frank is inconsistent on the abortion issue '' , but that 's it . it would be showing an inconsistency to show frank 's statement saying '' s2 am against all abortion '' , but then he has no problem with his wife getting an abortion cause she does n't want to lose her figure . nothing in his statement is '' inconsistent '' , __imo__ . if __s1__ say biden is '' inconsistent '' , __s1__ are also saying that about __s1__ 's position ... s2 know , if s2 are n't able to grasp the concept of the inconsistency of saying one is against gay marriage when saying they are for gay rights , __s1__ do n't know what else to say . it would be different if s2 did n't think gay marriage should be a right . but s2 do , so how could his position not be inconsistent to you ? to take s2 's abortion example , it would be like someone saying they are for reproductive / abortion rights , but yet being against it being legal for women to get an abortion at an abortion clinic . frankly , s2 are grasping at straws at this point . but that 's your position ... if __s1__ ca n't grasp that __s1__ are saying your own position is inconsistent , s2 do n't know what to say . yeah . __s1__ have no recollection of what s2 's position actually is , do you . as s2 have already explained to you , s2 see that a person can be for gay rights and against gay marriage . s2 see that a person can propose a compromise , that s2 personally would find acceptable . s2 ca n't tell __s1__ how many people have posted '' s2 do n't believe gay marriage is a right '' . if they also say '' s2 believe gays should have equal rights '' , there is no contradiction just cause s2 believe -lrb- let me repeat that , s2 believe -rrb- that gay marriage is a right . s2 think biden 's wrong . but his view is consistent . on another note , s2 am just amazed that __s1__ think __s1__ 's own position is inconsistent . s2 honestly had no idea ... are s2 just not reading the thread __????__ apparently not . let me repeat myself ... '' in the sense that saying one supports gay rights but not gay marriage , sure . '' __s1__ have already said __s1__ know it 's inconsistent , but that __s1__ do n't care . it 's not a pet issue for me . it is for you . yet s2 are far more concerned , it seems , about the inconsistency on __s1__ 's part than on biden 's part . yet it 's biden who 's s2 's candidate . stop the dishonesty of pretending __s1__ have n't already addressed that . actually , s2 did n't think __s1__ had recognized what __s1__ had admitted . next sentence __s1__ talked about biden ... '' more concerned '' ? s2 am arguing against the general position . it does n't matter who holds it . one of the points with biden , as explained in multiple points before , is how the perception of holding his feet to the fire could impact others ... if s2 could have a private one-on-one with biden , or if he logged on anonymously to this __web-site__ , s2 would discuss it with him just the same . quite frankly , the '' he 's our candidate '' thing is one of the things that takes precedent . see , we do n't approach these things as '' single issue '' type guys . we weigh the '' gay marriage opinion '' up against the impact of pushing him hard on it a few weeks away from election day , and balance the responding approach accordingly . s2 hear somewhere that '' single issue '' guys can be frowned upon . that ai n't us ...
ref_sum ->  it seems like they are discussing the inconsistency of each other 's arguments . __s1__ is getting annoyed and seems to just be arguing because they are `` venting '' while s2 is saying that the inconsistency is present and making all arguments invalid without proof . both __s1__ and s2 are for gay rights , s2 is stating that __s1__ is n't being consistent and `` admits '' to being inconsistent , while __s1__ is saying they do n't care about the inconsistency because of the point they are trying to get across . they bring up biden and abortion in ways that dont exactly fit the discussion , but just to show the inconsistency in each others opinions . s2 is saying they would handle this same situation with biden the exact same way because s2 is simply talking about perspective . __s1__ believes s2 is stating that __s1__ believes in gay marriage but not gay rights , which seems contradictory to __s1__ 's point . this argument does not have a set topic .
generated -> again , s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't mean there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency .

Article ->  because it 's all quite clear . decades of effort from the religious right , conservative republicans , and their like have made gay rights a poisoned topic . it 's a tragedy , but saying the right thing on this issue will cost s2 more votes than it will gain you , everyone knows it , and no one is going to do it . it 's politics 101 . the democrats , as a whole , want to do the right thing , but they know that if they say so too loudly they wo n't be in a position to do anything . they are forced to moderate their public stances so that they can get into positions where they can actually take action . this is of course a __generalization__ , but if s2 are talking about a political party as a whole that 's unavoidable . so , __s1__ are basically saying that biden was lying through his teeth when he said he does n't support gay marriage ? it was all just a lie to keep from losing votes ? interesting . possibly , __s1__ could n't say . certainly as a democrat he gets more benefit of the doubt than __s1__ would give a republican when it comes to gay rights , but __s1__ have n't __plumbed__ his record enough to say for sure . and let 's be honest here , s2 do not find the idea that a politician might be lying interesting . what s2 had prefer is that the candidates be honest about their views , whether it 's popular or unpopular . but even knowing we are talking about political candidates -lrb- who may lie to get votes -rrb- , when a candidate says something is his or her view , s2 think we have to take them at what they say when they answer a question like that so directly and emphatically . otherwise , there 's little point in asking questions to begin with other than maybe watching the reaction of body language and how they would respond under pressure , and so forth . political discourse has to operate to where when a candidate gives a given view as his or her view , they are taken at their word that is their view . '' no '' ca n't mean '' yes '' and so forth . no , that 's too __niave__ an approach . we know politicians are going to tell some lies , __s1__ trust that 's a given . we , as political consumers , ca n't simply take politicians at their word . if we want to make informed decisions about candidates we need to develop the skills to make useful judgement calls about what they are saying . we need to figure out how often they lie , what they lie about , how big their lies are . obviously we should n't need to do this , it would be great if we could actually take our politicians at their word . bad the sad reality is that we ca n't , not at this stage anyway . in this particular case , if biden says he does n't support gay marriage __s1__ is just as likely to think it 's because he knows that open support could cost him the white house as any other reason . it 's sad that such double speak is needed , __s1__ had love it if enough courageous politicians stood forth and ended the political need for lies , but until that wonderful day __s1__ is not going to be naive and take everything they say at their word , nor am __s1__ going to jump up and down and point fingers at every __falsehood__ . i 'll try to judge the politicians by their actions , and their lies by their magnitude , scope , and quantity . s2 think __s1__ are misunderstanding me -- s2 do n't mean s2 think we should assume they are going to always tell the truth -- s2 mean we should put the expectation on them to be honest . __iow__ , honesty is what we should demand . if we are n't even going to do that , there 's no point in ever asking a political candidate a direct question . knowing they are going to lie is n't the same as having the expectation on them to be honest . s2 really do n't think it 's too much to ask our candidates to say what their views are . __s1__ just said yourself '' we need to figure out how often they lie , what they lie about , how big their lies are '' so , obviously , __s1__ believe it 's not really good that they are lying . there would be little point in asking them questions if we are n't going to hold to them to some level of expectation that they are going to say what they mean . sure , they lie , but if the words of politicians mean nothing , there 's little point in even having political discourse . political cynicism is no excuse to not put expectations on our candidates to be honest with the american people .
ref_sum ->  this is about politics and whether or not the lie in order to get more votes . __s1__ believes politicians sometimes may lie as long as its what is the majority , while s2 is saying that s2 is more concerned with the honesty of the candidates rather than whether they are lying or not . s2 says we should expect them to be honest , because that is what we should want from politicians . __s1__ argues that politicians seem to lie in order to get the position they want or sway people to become popular , while s2 thinks that we should rely on them to make the right decision . __s1__ seems to think that s2 is making an argument for their belief , but s2 is just trying to be honest and show the other perspective . they argue about politicians lying through discussing when politicians are asked questions and how they answer them . s2 finishes by telling __s1__ we should not label politicians and expect them to do and say the right , honest thing .
generated -> conservative republicans say the right thing on this issue will cost s2 more votes than it will gain you , everyone knows it , and no one is going to do it . it 's politics 101 , but if s2 are talking about a political party as a whole that 's unavoidable . so , s1 are basically saying that biden was lying through his teeth when he said he does n't support gay marriage ?

Article ->  we do n't just benefit from what is often considered the common , nuclear family . we benefit from families with adopted children , step children , families with no children at all . no it does not . prove it will come up , and also prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . marriage is that now . s2 are right , it has nothing to do with the bible . it has everything to do with the slippery slope logical __fallacy__ , which we have discussed in the forum ad __nauseum__ . it only shows that those opposed do not have an argument . s2 know the prospect of incest and polygamy is much less socially acceptable than gay marriage , so s2 try to erroneously tie polygamy and incest to gay marriage in people 's mind to strike fear in them , and hope their logical reasoning can be replaced by irrational fear . a married couple as the head of a home is considered a nuclear family it already has . the question of legality is what this whole issue is about . marriage is a legal __instituation__ , how could legality not come up . yes it is whoa ... hold up ... are __s1__ saying that only because gay marriage is less unacceptable that incestuous relations , that its ok to grant gay marriage but not sibling marriage ?? if the incestuous society begin to parade and protest , until society accepts them on the level that they accept gays now , what will __s1__ say then ? on what grounds should we discriminate against 2 siblings wanting to get married , particularly if they believe they truly love each other , or if they believe that they were born with that attraction ? this is classic __hypocracy__ . if 2 siblings want to love each other in their private lives , how is that any business of yours ? and what does irrational fear have to do with anything ? do __s1__ have an irrational fear of an incestuous or polygamous lifestyle ? based on what ? give me one reason why society __shouldnt__ accept an incestuous relation between two consenting adults then what may lead to incest and polygamy is the fact that marriage is a legal institution , is that what s2 are saying ? if so , these things may come up equally as a result of straight legal marriage or gay legal marriage or interracial legal marriage , or legal __inter-faith__ marriage or legal marriage with legal divorce , etc. . it does n't relate specifically to gay legal marriage at all . __s1__ was saying this is how many people attempt an argument against gay marriage , by attempting to incite fear by spouting off a parade of __horribles__ that have nothing to do with the issue of gay marriage . what if straight people are married and winged green monkeys come flying out of everyone 's derriere in the future ? what will s2 do then ? demonstrate how gay marriage specifically relates to incest and incestuous marriage and polygamy . this is the gay rights forum , not the incest forum . thats not what im saying . what may lead to incestuous marriage is if siblings or related people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . and what may lead to polygamous marriage is 3 or more people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . do __s1__ see a pattern here ? __ooooh__ . . nice way to snake out of the issue ... let me refresh __s1__ 's memory since __s1__ brought it up , what exactly does the social acceptance of any type of '' taboo '' relationship have to do with their right to be legally married ? is there a certain limit of '' __tabooness__ '' , and if __youre__ past that limit then no marriage for you ? and what fear are __s1__ talking about ? s2 is talking about people that love each other and want to tie the knot . how could that possibly strike fear in somebody ? please ... . yes , that 's true . yes , that 's true . are s2 saying love is the pattern ? well , love applies to straight marriages as well as gay marriages . love is not exclusive to gay marriages . if that 's the connection , we can just as easily say straight marriage will lead to incestuous marriage and polygamy . s2 are saying love will cause a slippery slope . it 's still __fallacious__ . the issue __s1__ brought up was why this __fallacy__ is often used , that is to create fear , because incest and polygamy are indeed considered so taboo . the issue is not the __tabooness__ of anything and everything , but how it is being used to distract from the issue of same-sex marriage , when there is n't a logical , rational argument against same-sex marriage . it 's an indication of desperation on the part of some of those who are against same-sex marriage . __s1__ have no reason to discuss the level of __acceptability__ or lack thereof of every single thing , before __s1__ accept one thing that is different from all those other things . __s1__ can deal with that one thing on all of its own merits and shortfalls , without being drawn into a false dilemma , either accept everything or else do n't accept one thing , as if those are the only two choices , __fallacy__ . gay marriage will change the definition of marriage from '' a legal union between a man and a woman '' to '' a legal union between any parties that love each other '' . if its ok for 2 people that love each other and want to tie the knot , then how could incest be a taboo ? based on what ? again with the double standard . gay marriage was considered just as much a taboo as incest or polygamy just a few years ago . being gay emerged from its taboo status through parades , promotional efforts , and , unfortunately , by spreading lies -lrb- i 'll deal with that in another thread -rrb- . however , incestuous people __didnt__ go through the process of parading their lifestyle in front of the world and practically begging for approval from society . so incest is still deeper in taboo status than homosexuality . why is it ok to deny incestuous relations the right to marry on the grounds that it is considered taboo , but ok to approve gay marriage on the same grounds ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are debating whether making gay marriage legal will open opportunities for other `` taboos '' in our society . __s1__ believes that in opening this opportunity for gay marriage , the definition of marriage will change and it will allow other issues like incest and polygamy to become legal . s2 accuses __s1__ of __hypocracy__ . in a sense , they believe gay marriage will have a sort of domino effect for other issues . __s1__ is arguing that using these other issues to be evidence for why !!__gay-marriage__!! should n't be allowed is not a valid argument . then __s1__ goes on to say that this tactic is used to instill fear to those who do not support those other issues . __s1__ understands the other issues , but does n't see the relationship between those and that of same-sex marriage . s2 keeps arguing that it __shouldnt__ be different figuring out whether one can approve gay marriage but not incest since they believe the two to be somewhat related .
generated -> prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . marriage is that now , and prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . it has everything to do with the slippery slope logical fallacy , which we have discussed in the forum ad nauseum .

Article ->  matt , this is getting ridiculous . s2 made an assertion that republicans would send gays to concentration camps like the germans did in the holocaust . then s2 brought up a statement by paul cameron , as if paul cameron has anything to do whatsoever with republican politics or leadership . now if s2 had linked someone in the republican leadership saying those things , s2 might have something , but s2 did n't . paul cameron is a psychologist that has gone over the top at times with some of the things he 's said about gays and has paid a price for it . he 's a frequent target of the gay pride movement for __demonization__ and because he did n't tow the line with the apa 's political stances , they distanced themselves from him . __s1__ do n't agree with everything he says either , for that matter . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking ; the most s2 can say is that they are paul cameron talking . well , sure -- anything could happen . a military coup could take place and we had have martial law . a new ice age could start in the next year . an asteroid could be on its way to hit earth . but there 's a big difference between possibility and likelihood . paul cameron is the single most frequently quoted '' expert '' cited by the gop in all their attempts to limit the rights of gay people . his '' research '' has been entered in the congressional record countless times . it really is astounding that anyone would have anything to do with him . including you . what price ? without his revolting beliefs and __star-power__ , he had be flipping burgers somewhere . instead , he 's raking in a fortune speaking to the '' moral '' groups __s1__ are constantly defending . he was dismissed from the group for conducting fraudulent research . cameron talking ... gop repeating . seriously , __jyoshu__ , the man called for extermination . how can __s1__ support him or cite him or defend him at all __??????__ how can s2 not stay on point ? unless cameron is a part of the gop __leadeship__ , matt is pulling some wild point out of his hat , saying that because someone who may not even be a republican hates gays , that republicans hate gays . __s1__ might as well have said that since john lennon attacked religion , then democrats hate religion . yes , his comments are that ludicrous . this is not about paul cameron no matter how much s2 had love to change the subject , it 's about matt 's ridiculous __generalizations__ and comments . oh , and s2 need to get up with the times -- no national political party has used cameron 's information in a serious way in a long time . __s1__ is sure you 'll now be googling to try and find republican individuals out there on the internet citing cameron , but that 's not the party leadership or its platform . there is no republican in leadership that would call for the extermination of gays , and s2 know it . nor does the platform say so . so let 's put that little lie to bed right now . sorry , sir . since __s1__ did n't stay on point , s2 thought others were just as free to wander . if democratic legislators from sea to shining sea quoted lennon 's lyrics about '' imagine no religion '' at every session that talked about religious freedom , __s1__ might draw that conclusion , no ? __ooops__ . s2 thought it was about a conservative democrat in minnesota bragging about '' inside information '' from that state 's supreme court . uh ... how about the president of the united states ??? paul cameron 's research is cited in virtually every single attack on gay people in state after state after state legislature . it was presented in the '' debate '' about same-sex marriage in the u.s. __friggin__ ' senate . his name appears in the citations of virtually every legal brief filed by opponents of same-sex marriage . __http__ think he even made it into lawrence v. texas . the man is president of the family research institute . he can probably phone up ol ' __dubya__ anytime he gets the urge . and __dubya__ will put down his pretzel and pick up the phone . what should be put to bed is paul cameron and every single bogus study related to him . that supposedly reasonable people would even mention his name is surprising . ok , __s1__ now realize something __s1__ did n't earlier -- that __http__ are obviously a dnc __shill__ . no one else would make such a ridiculous __generalization__ . __http__ really do think that 's all conservatives talk about , huh ? __s1__ hate to bust __http__ 's bubble , but it 's not . __s1__ know __http__ 's martyr complex is important to you , but it 's just not accurate . -lrb- shrug -rrb- what are __s1__ talking about ? s2 said __s1__ had probably be right to assume that some people were __anti-religion__ if they consistently talked about what a wonderful world it would be without it ? over and over . at every opportunity . and never had a single nice word to say about it . ever . __s1__ really are laughable when __s1__ try to defend the gop when one of their admittedly most effective propaganda campaigns is to rally the '' __family-values__ '' crowd against gay rights . it 's openly admitted by them . they are proud of their tactics . very odd ...
ref_sum ->  this seems to be an argument about gay rights and !!__generalizing__!! the political beliefs of people . according to __s1__ , s2 talks about paul cameron and makes it seem as if he is the voice of the republicans . __s1__ argues that it is not the case and one person who sides with a specific party does n't represent the party . __s1__ uses john lennon as an example of this not being a proper way to !!__generalize__!! political views of parties , in his case the democratic party . __s1__ accuses s2 of making an assertion including the republicans creating another holocaust , because of the !!__generalization__!! that s2 made . s2 believes that paul cameron 's views are cited and used in many cases against gay rights because most people do share the same views , which __s1__ thinks otherwise . s2 says that most attacks on gay rights have cited paul cameron , even within the us senate , showing that he has a strong opinion in the republican party , or at least it seems so .
generated -> is a psychologist that has gone over the top at times with some of the things he 's said about gays and has paid a price for that matter . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking ; the most s2 can say is that they are paul cameron talking . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking ; the most s2 can say is that they are paul cameron talking . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking .

ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are debating the issue of freedom of speech and gay rights . __s1__ is against gay rights and believes they earned their freedom of speech through serving in the military . s2 believes everyone has the freedom of speech and is against speaking out towards other kinds of people . __s1__ is very rude and constantly being immature towards s2 . s2 states that we are granted freedom of speech by the constitution , and __s1__ responds with immature remarks and questions . s2 points out that __s1__ has no evidence of any sort for his arguments and that believing in the bible should not be a reason to dictate everyone else 's rights . also , s2 adds that he does n't need to prove his beliefs the same way __s1__ should n't dictate his beliefs . __s1__ seems to be ignorant to the actual context of the conversation while s2 is in belief that __s1__ should n't use his beliefs to dictate the rights of other individuals .

ref_sum ->  this debate is about the 9th and how the federal constitution applies to marriage . __s1__ and s2 begin by talking about trolling and potentially starting a new debate on abortion , which does n't really have a lot of purpose in this conversation . s2 says that in saying people who want to get rid of gay marriage may have wanted to prevent __inter-racial__ and inter religious marriage . s2 states that maine 's vote on gay marriage was an opinion on gay marriage , rather than the 9th being how the federal constitution applies to gay marriage . s2 also says that bowers justice stevens does n't have the evidence to withstand his analysis . they also bring up lawrence v. texas and s2 states that even when majority wants a law it is n't enough for the constitution challenge of the law . s2 goes back to saying how __s1__ 's arguments are flawed and that its too repetitive for this conversation , because __s1__ has n't disproved anything . they go back to talking trash to each other and they end the conversation .

Article ->  s2 do know that the gay marriage debate is not synonymous with someone condoning violence against gays , right ? __s1__ seriously doubt anyone here does n't agree with s2 that gays should n't experience violence and name-calling , so that 's not even an issue on the table here . disagree and debate those who believe gay marriage is wrong all s2 want . but do n't dishonestly use arguments about violence , because no one here has argued for that . s2 is sorry , but have __s1__ read archie 's posts ??? he regularly __denigrates__ gays with a variety of slurs . and palin never asked for somebody to threaten obama either . but her rhetoric inflamed people to extremes that are grotesque . oh please . do n't start that subjective __canard__ again . if every religious person who genuinely disagreed with gay marriage because of their religion added a ' __but-no-violence__ ! ' __addendum__ to __everytime__ they weighed in on it , do s2 think anyone actually thinks s2 had be satisfied ? um ... no . it 's funny how the whole violence thing gets used as a __means-to-an-end__ tool by those who argue against religious people on this . well , it would be funny if it were n't sad to some extent . people should n't have to stop standing up for their principles just because of __nutcases__ out there . if the shoe fits ... s2 is talking about the people who proclaim abusive lies about gays . people who put out junk that makes people feel threatened by gays . telling people that gay marriage will makes their kids have to be taught about gay marriage ? that 's a threat . telling people that gay marriage will require churches to have to perform gay marriages ? that 's perceived as a threat too . s2 have no doubt that some people can discuss the subject without inciting . but on the prop 8 battle , the ads clearly were __inciteful__ . do __s1__ think that if a person talks about an abortion doctor '' killing babies '' , that does n't push somebody to think about claiming '' self-defense '' or '' defense of others '' ? how many people do __s1__ think are out there that have attacked a gay person that actually had somebody tell them '' s2 think __s1__ should go out and kill a gay person '' ? it 's built up toxicity from all the anti-gay rhetoric that reaches a boiling point . when the rhetoric __inflames__ , it 's obvious where it starts when somebody gets burned ... oh . and can s2 just say that while s2 am impressed __s1__ did n't try to attack me , __s1__ are doing a bad job of ignoring me ... yeah , when it fits . not other contexts . jason did n't make that distinction which is why __s1__ took issue with him on it . __s1__ did n't say __s1__ was going to start ignoring you , __foundit__ . __s1__ made clear __s1__ was done with that discussion . __s1__ did not say __s1__ was going to stop responding to s2 __foundit__ . and regarding s2 's comment about ' attacking ' , it 's because s2 's tone has changed in the last few posts -- s2 have turned off the hostility some , for __whatver__ reason , and it 's the nature of things that honey draws less flies than **** . that 's why s2 no longer perceive as being '' attacked . '' quite simply , s2 require a __fight-fire-with-fire__ approach , and so tone s2 are treated with -lrb- from me , anyway -rrb- depends entirely on you . and considering he was responding to archie , one of the guys who has got the worst track record on this message board for abusive slurs towards gays , s2 think he was right on track . oh . silly me . so that was just a lame attempt to dodge that conversation then . the one where s2 had just finished explaining how __s1__ were moving the __goal-posts__ and __obfuscating__ up a storm . s2 guess '' __clafclo__ '' was more successful than s2 thought . it 's amusing to watch __s1__ turn on __s1__ 's __passive-aggressive__ claims , and then turn them off again . when __s1__ need it as an excuse , you 'll start whining about '' attacks '' again , even as __s1__ drop claims that s2 should n't be a moderator of any board ... which s2 is sure is n't an '' attack '' or '' personal information '' in __s1__ 's book , hmmm ? and also , __s1__ 's response here is doing exactly what s2 noted on the other thread . __s1__ are dropping the majority of the topical text , and making more of an interest in that one __side-note__ comment ... __s1__ said __namecalling__ and violence , __foundit__ . those were the things jason __conflated__ with opposing gay marriage . once again s2 are being disingenuous again -- respond to what __s1__ actually said for once . show where archie has ever called gays names before , like the f word , or called for violence against gays . if s2 can , i 'll be glad to retract the comment . __namecalling__ and violence are wrong , regardless of where people fall on the issue of gay marriage . in fact , more importantly , they are always wrong no matter what the issue . whatever s2 want to think , __foundit__ . it 's not worth arguing over with a brick wall . __geeez__ __foundit__ . __s1__ suspect personal comments about posters are starting to compete or even outnumber pertinent points about issues s2 are making at this point . __s1__ think __s1__ is going to start using an __acronymn__ whenever s2 do so , that says personal comments & attacks do n't deal with issues . '' __pcaddwi__ '' . that way it will be noted when s2 do it , but it allow s2 to continue dragging down the thread with them . -lrb- or at least you 'll be completely alone in doing so . -rrb- __pcaddwi__ . quote him . quote exactly what he said . cause jason did no such thing ... were __s1__ looking in the mirror when __s1__ said that ? are __s1__ for real ? we have already got archie 's '' __bitchy__ as a gay '' comment . s2 never said he called gays '' __xxxxxx__ '' before . but ai n't it interesting how this board will sensor __######__ or __####__ , but if __s1__ say __xxxxxx__ , it 's __a-ok__ ... the fact that __s1__ argue with me on so many issues , but then throw this arbitrary argument out there , __belittles__ __s1__ 's claim and demonstrates an ulterior motive for ignoring the statement . are __s1__ going to label __s1__ 's own statements as such __jyoshu__ ? cause __s1__ have this boring habit of starting __passive-aggressive__ attacks , belittling other people , and then when somebody calls __s1__ on it or says something about it __s1__ eventually drop it and act surprised when other people point out __s1__ dropped it .
ref_sum ->  this is about the use of arguments of violence towards !!__gay-marriage__!! . __s1__ starts off saying there is a difference between being anti-gay and someone condoning violence against gay people . s2 talks about how violence is used to make people feel threatened to feel a certain way about a topic or debate . s2 used the example of kids being taught about gay marriage in school as a threat . s2 also mentions someone named archie who posts include a variety of slurs towards gay people . __s1__ brushes on the topic , but goes off track from the topic quite a bit . these two people start referring to each others `` attacks '' on each other towards the end . __s1__ says they were referring to !!__namecalling__!! and violence from the original post that was opposing gay rights . these two are n't really in opposite !!__positions/beliefs__!! , but they are more trying to discuss the ways they argue for or against gay marriage and how it may be portrayed by others .
generated -> s1 seriously doubt anyone here does n't agree with s2 . if every religious person who genuinely disagreed with gay marriage because of their religion added a ' but-no-violence ! ' addendum to everytime they weighed in on . but on the prop 8 battle , the ads clearly were inciteful . but on the prop 8 battle , the ads clearly were inciteful .

Article ->  any two adults can run the household , one can make the decision if the other is incapacitated , one inherits when the other dies , etc etc. . that parallel does not carry over to group marriages . when one dies , who inherits ? if one is __incapacitied__ , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two , so __recongnising__ group marriages is a huge legal task , and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious . if we are talking about legal recognition , and we are -lrb- right ? -rrb- , then the cases are wildly different . our marriage laws , for better or worse , are set up on the assumption of two adults running a household . they also assume man and wife , true , but do n't actually depend on that . but the dependence on there being two people is embedded in the laws ; changing that is a huge project . yes , but gays would also want laws changed to __accomodate__ their form of marriage as well . the fact that one requires less change than the other should n't matter , should it ? should having to do more __reworking__ of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality ? it seems to me __s1__ 's argument boils down to '' polygamy requires more work to make the laws __accomodate__ it . '' yeah -- such is the price for marriage equality . let 's face it -- if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for __opposite-sex__ couples which comprise most relationships , they could pull it off -- polygamy , gays , letting 17 year olds marry , etc. . all those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed . means could be set up to determine inheritance , for example . laws can be worded to do it . see , this is why we try to avoid this debate . those who oppose gay marriage inevitably put their own spin on it and drag it to silly conclusion . here we see what gays really want turned into '' make marriage an open-ended institution of equality '' , which then means gay , poly , and 17 year olds in this case . __jyoshu__ stopped there , but it 's not uncommon for it then to go to children , cousins , dogs , whatever . this issue is not '' let 's let everyone do anything they like '' , that 's just the common __reframing__ we see whenever poly relations are brought up while __disscusing__ gay marriage . it happens all the time , it gets old , and that 's why people who have gone through it a bunch of times tend to __aviod__ the whole thing . it happens because there 's no way to avoid logical conclusions . believe it or not , cultural and legal precedent is a very real thing . the events in the article __exemplify__ this . if __s1__ argue to broaden marriage -lrb- which __s1__ are -rrb- , then this is what __s1__ have to deal with . as __s1__ said , s2 did stop with polygamy , gay , and barely lowering the age of consent , so why are you bringing up all the other examples like '' children , cousins dogs , '' or whatever , as if __s1__ were ready to pounce on that ? __s1__ are arguing against degrees that s2 did n't even say , or that no one said . now , do __s1__ have any response to s2 's point that __s1__ 's argument boils down to nothing more than '' polygamy requires more work to make the laws __accomodate__ it '' , or are __s1__ just going to avoid it by getting __sidetracked__ by the fact __s1__ do n't like that we are even talking about this ? again , society can deal with issues like polygamy if they really want to . sure there is . s2 can start with an erroneous assumption , like s2 did , and then arrive at an illogical conclusion , like s2 did . why do n't s2 read the exchanges between me and phyllis ; __s1__ think most of s2 's issues will be addressed that way . do __s1__ feel that opening marriage to gay couples is not a case of broadening marriage ? how is that an erroneous assumption ? sure , but s2 asked __s1__ some specific questions that __s1__ seem to be avoiding . in __s1__ 's exchange with phyllis s2 may comment on matters s2 disagree with . listen to yourself ! we start with '' gays want to get married '' , s2 change it to '' make marriage an open-ended institution of equality '' , and now s2 __segue__ over to '' broadening marriage '' . s2 's erroneous assumption is s2 's statement of what gays are trying to accomplish . until s2 stop trying to change what gays really want into something that s2 can argue against more easily all s2 's arguments will be based on erroneous assumptions . actually , __s1__ did address them . while debating with phyllis . naturally . and naturally __s1__ may ignore them if __s1__ think they are diversions . what gays are trying or not trying -lrb- in terms of intent -rrb- is not the issue . what is the crux here is that marriage would be broadened . it 's not rocket science . __s1__ are moving the boundaries of what constitutes a marriage to include more than __opposite-sex__ couples . very straightforward . s2 know __s1__ do n't like it __phrased__ that way , but that 's what it is . __s1__ ca n't take a phrase like ' gays want to get married '' without looking at the overall implications . in terms of legal rights , s2 do n't see why it would be any different . equality in marriage is equality in marriage regardless of the cultural motivation -- religious , being in love with more than one person , or simply just for the hell of it . for that matter , the argument could be made that __opposite-sex__ marriage between 2 people is largely a religious construct ! i 'll try to explain this to s2 one more time . the stated purpose of gays is quite __relevent__ if s2 are trying to argue against it . gays want to get married . one side effect of that is that some people will see the scope of marriage broadened . gays are not , in and of itself , trying to broaden marriage . they did not wake up one day and say '' let 's try to broaden the scope of marriage today , that 'll be fun ! '' s2 's arguments run along the lines of '' if s2 want to __braoden__ marriage , than s2 must __excpet__ it broadening in all these other ways '' and that 's why s2 's __rephrasing__ does n't work . broadening marriage is n't the goal , it 's a side effect , and since it is n't the goal we do n't have to accept all these other things s2 claim would be the result if they were trying to broaden marriage . to recap , s2 's arguments are based on s2 's assumption that gays want to broaden marriage , that that is their __ulitmate__ goal , the pinnacle of the cause . gays getting married to s2 seems to be the means to that end . that is , of course , backwards , and so s2 's __sematic__ based arguments fail . __kronos__ , s2 just told __s1__ s2 am not dealing here with what gays are trying / not trying to do in terms of intent , yet __s1__ are are arguing as if s2 never even said that . s2 am not arguing what gays have as intent . s2 completely understand what __s1__ are saying . s2 's point here is based on the effect of their intents , whatever that intent is . there is simply no way to get around the fact that if __s1__ change marriage to include other that __opposite-sex__ couples -lrb- to any number of other possibilities -- even one -rrb- , __s1__ are broadening marriage . whether or not gays set out out to do this in terms of a goal is irrelevant . __s1__ are attacking some point about intent that s2 have n't made -- s2 is talking about the effect here . to latch onto some straw man of '' intent '' is to completely miss the point . __s1__ is not ignoring this post , __s1__ is simply choosing not to respond because it 's a pointless distraction in an otherwise __interesing__ thread . if s2 want to start another thread on this theme i 'll explain there how wrong s2 are . well , __s1__ are the one that 's taking issue and making it a distraction !
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : !!__opposers__!! to gay marriage often jump to conclusions about who can get married - why not cousins , group marriages , children , dogs ? polygamous marriage raises legal concerns that are not currently covered in traditional marriage laws , for example . the goal of gay marriage supporters is to be able to get married - not to broaden marriage . broadened marriage is a side effect of legal gay marriage . s2 : gay marriage supporters want marriage laws changed to accommodate gay marriage . broadened marriage could change the current traditional marriage laws . polygamy , for example , would require more marriage laws changed than gay marriage would , as more people are involved . but if enough people wanted legal polygamous marriage , the laws would be passed . marriage would be broadened if gay marriage is made legal , whether that is the goal of gay marriage or not .
generated -> if one is incapacitied , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that parallel does not carry over to group marriages . if one is incapacitied , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two , so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task , and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious that

Article ->  do n't __s1__ think that in 1909 it was probably viewed mostly from a moral standpoint ? __s1__ do n't think they saw it the same way they would see black people . they did n't even realize that ' homosexuality ' was any sort of innate thing . it was entirely behavioral to them . __s1__ tend to agree with the court , even given what __s1__ have said . __s1__ doubt for 1909 it was about prejudice and bigotry -- they genuinely felt it was wrong . the concept of gay marriage was completely foreign and unknown in 1909 . it was n't even something they conceived of . __s1__ think the court is saying that they could n't have been prejudiced against something they did n't even know of or conceive of . __hogwash__ . it was once entirely moral to believe certain races were inferior , and that women had fewer rights than men . treating the races and women as equal was not something even thought of by many . it was prejudice against gays then , and it still is today . this is not really true . it 's a popular __misconstruing__ of morality and history by proponents of modern ' rights ' movements , but it 's not true . there 's little historical backing to the idea that people believed __oppressing__ black people was a right thing to do , as in , doing good . there were times they used an argument where religion was wrongly used to justify their behavior , but that 's a different matter . if s2 firmly believe otherwise , __s1__ had challenge s2 to show where people thought __oppressing__ blacks was an example if doing good . the same goes for misogyny . furthermore , it 's beside the point anyway . we are talking about homosexuality . in 1909 , the only thing they really understood about the issue at hand was that some people engaged in sexual relations with people of their own gender . there were no articles about '' homosexuality '' as a trait , and certainly none about genetic causes . it was understood entirely from a behavioral standpoint , and therefore a moral standpoint . so it 's not __hogwash__ at all -- they really did view gay sex as immoral . if s2 do n't think so , then s2 have a very poor grasp on history in this case . this kind of morality is based on nothing but ignorance -lrb- which __s1__ admit -rrb- and prejudice . what kind of a basis is that for a so-called moral code ? so what if it involves behaviour ? gay people have sex , develop relationships , and bond , just like everyone else , but in a way that reflects their gay sexuality . this does not mean people could not be prejudiced about the way gay people live . people were , and are so prejudiced . a better reverse analogy would have been to say '' so then __conversly__ __s1__ have the right to advocate that heterosexual relations are morally wrong '' . not __heterosexuality__ , since it 's not homosexuality -lrb- as it 's a state of being -rrb- that religious people have a problem with . heck , they often do n't even recognize it . with that caveat , yes s2 are certainly free to advocate whatever s2 want to be morally wrong . -lrb- and unlike the way some in s2 's movement do , __s1__ wo n't call s2 a '' bigot '' for doing so ! -rrb- it may have been based on '' ignorance '' , but __s1__ reject the notion it was based on prejudice -lrb- and therefore __s1__ tend to agree with the 6 - 0 view of the justices here -rrb- . the 1909 society had too little understanding of gay people to be prejudiced over in the first place . remember , homosexuality was not understood as a state of being at that time . the term itself had not been around long and was not known to most people . and even to those it was known to , it was not known as a state of being . and there certainly was no social identity among gay people as a group -- how could prejudice have existed if there was nothing -lrb- from their perspective -rrb- to be prejudiced toward ? right . provided gays do n't live gay , but live straight , gays can be as gay as they want . as long as gays do n't outwardly show what makes them different from __straights__ , gays can be as gay as they want . it 's bs . also some may not recognize the existence of gay people or their gay lives , but that is putting one 's head in the sand . nonsense . people would widely and __hatefully__ use the term '' __sodomite__ '' to refer to gays . before that the term was '' molly '' . clearly there was an identity they were prejudiced towards . they were rounding up gays in areas they were known to attend , and putting them in prison . read up on the trial of oscar wilde . gays may have been forced underground , to a greater extent , but that does not mean they were not thought of . gays were just not thought of in a nice way . gays were purposely kept out of everything in society , when society did n't really think of gays as human too . that is n't prejudice ? because they did n't approve of sodomy ! do s2 not agree they did n't understand the concept of homosexuality ??? there was no social identity . when they were put on trial , it was n't because they were gay -lrb- which they had no concept of -rrb- , it was because they had gay relations which society viewed as wrong ! no , here 's where s2 do n't get it -- it 's not that '' gays '' -lrb- there was no concept of that -rrb- were purposely kept out of of everything , it 's that people who had sodomy relationships were kept out of everything , because sodomy was viewed as wrong . they really did think it was wrong ! s2 are so determined to portray everything that has anything to do with gay relations possibly being wrong as prejudice and bigotry that s2 are __close-minded__ about it .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : in 1909 , being homosexual was morally wrong , and people could be prejudiced about something that they did not recognize as innate . there was little historical evidence to prove that people in 1909 believed that it was `` right '' or `` good '' to !!__oppress__!! black people or women , and this sentiment extend to homosexuals . in 1909 , people knew that gay sex occurred and they understood its occurrence to be entirely behavioral , and therefore , immoral . homosexuality was not understood as a social identity back then , so there was no `` gay lifestyle '' to be prejudiced against . sodomy was criminalized , not being gay . s2 : there was prejudice against gays in 1909 just as there is now . the !!__immorality__!! of homosexuality in 1909 is based on ignorance . as long as gay people `` lived straight '' , they could be as sexually !!__non-normative__!! as they wanted to be . there were terms for gay men back then , like !!__sodomite__!! and molly , so there was a clear identity for people to be prejudiced against . men who `` acted gay '' were punished for it in 1909 .

ref_sum ->  __s1__ : religion is a good tool to guide one 's own actions , but not for telling others how to live . people have been prejudiced against homosexuals for a long time . moral or religious prejudice is still prejudice . a person can claim a moral or religious stance without having one . you can not justify an anti-gay agenda on morals or religion . an anti-gay stance on the grounds of religious belief is prejudice . prejudice based on religious belief implies that a religious person 's acts of prejudice could have a negative impact on homosexuals , because they believe that being gay is morally reprehensible . s2 : prejudice is a fact of human existence . christianity is a moral system . when people claim religion in morals , they abandon that moral system . it is religious belief - not prejudice - that makes one take an anti-gay stance . the bible says that homosexuality is wrong , so if you believe in the bible as your moral canon , then you believe that homosexuality is wrong as well .

Article ->  new england and new york will probably have gay marriage within the next few years . the west coast might also follow suit after that . __s1__ think the recent wave of gay marriage legalization will stop for the next 20 years or so after that . 30 states already define marriage as between a man and a woman . do n't be so sure . if congress removes doma and with roberts and alito on the court same sex marriage will come to the rest of the country with a 7 to 2 ruling . roberts and alito are constitutional __literalists__ and with doma out of the way the full faith and credit clause is a clear constitutional mandate . can s2 demonstrate evidence that the __scotus__ would nullify gay marriage bans in all states ? if the __scotus__ was so imposed , why do n't they just strike doma down right now and then declare all gay marriage bans unconstitutional ? secondly , states can choose not to recognize gay marriage even without federal doma . there is a choice of law doctrine that allows states to not recognize other states marriages that they find '' offensive '' to their own public policy . states have been not recognizing each others marriages for decades and states do not use the __ffc__ clause to make one state recognize another 's marriage . there is no case history of __ffc__ ever used in this way . even in cases where it has been attempted , the legal argument involved is so lengthy , that it effectively prohibits __ffc__ use due to the sheer amount of hassle and legal proceedings involved in winning such a case . it is called the constitution of the united states a marriage license is a public act and record which __http__ are obviously ignorant of . __http__ completely failed to respond to the choice of law doctrine , as well as __s1__ 's request that __http__ provide justification on __http__ 's claims of how each justice would vote , as well as __s1__ 's challenge to __http__ to explain why doma has not been declared unconstitutional if __http__ 's claims about the justices were true . apparently , the law is beyond __http__ 's comprehension , as is __http__ 's ability to consider facts in forming __http__ 's opinions . in answer to __s1__ 's question . steven , kennedy , souter , ginsburg , and breyer will side with us . roberts and alito will follow the constitution as written . scalia and thomas are a lost anti gay cause . that is how s2 know how they will vote . as to why doma has not been declared unconstitutional is because there has not been a case in the courts challenging doma and so has not been taken up by __scotus__ . i 'll do a little research on s2 's claims . regardless , s2 still failed to address how state courts may use the choice of law doctrine so that the __ffc__ clause does not apply , and if it were , the sheer complication of applying the law would make it effectively prohibitive . by all means , post up the __ffc__ clause again so s2 can avoid addressing this . s2 do not see how choice of law doctrine is not trumped by the full faith and credit clause in cases of marriage contract since there is a current tradition of one state respecting other states marriage licenses when it comes to __heteros__ . the choice of law doctrine is used to settle differences between different state laws . that is how the law is practiced , and that is what courts believe . again , states have been disagreeing on the validity of each other 's marriages for decades and there has been no case history of the full faith and credit clause that has made one state recognize another state 's marriage . courts look to the choice of law doctrine before the __ff__ & c c.
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : legally , it is complicated to legalize gay marriage in all states , as doma is in place and states have chosen not to recognize other state 's marriages for decades . attempts abide by the __ffc__ clause to in respect to marriage -lrb- even before doma -rrb- require such lengthy legal arguments that they are rendered prohibitive . the choice of law doctrine must be considered and doma could be found to be unconstitutional by vote of the __scotus__ . how will states use the choice of law doctrine so that the __ffc__ clause does not apply ? s2 : if congress removes doma , a vote for legal gay marriage will pass quickly , and certain justices of __scotus__ already approve of gay marriage . doma has yet to be declared unconstitutional because there has yet to be a case made to challenge doma in the courts , so it has not been decided upon by __scotus__ . the choice of law doctrine trumps the __ffc__ clause in cases of marriage contract and there is a current tradition of respecting other states marriage licenses for .
generated -> s1 think the recent wave of gay marriage legalization will stop for the next 20 years . if congress removes doma and with roberts and alito on the court same sex marriage will come to the rest of the country with a 7 to 2 ruling . if congress removes doma and with roberts and alito on the court same sex marriage will come to the rest of the country with a 7 to 2 ruling .

Article ->  withers dc council votes for gay marriage by james withers , contributing editor , 365 gay blog __12.15.2009__ pm est in a 11 - 2 vote , the city council of washington , dc voted for gay marriage . we are a bit __short-handed__ today , so expect more about this later . until then have a sip of the bubbly and congrats to the district . wait until it 's put on a ballot for the voters to decide . this is n't the first time that a liberal government did n't pay attention to the will of the people . and what is the will of the people jp ? people in support of marriage equality is steadily growing . compare the polls from ten years ago to now to see ... it is only a matter of time before equality stands upon the side of the majority . s2 keep hearing gays say that but every time it 's put to a vote , __s1__ lose . s2 had say that it 's time to try another tact because the current one is a losing proposition . the only thing forcing gay marriage on a population does is galvanize them against the forced action . and when they respond on the ballot , they do so __punatively__ . just wait until __s1__ see the repercussions of the current efforts to give all federal employee 's same sex partners __bennies__ on our dime despite doma . s2 is guessing that some additional democratic heads will roll in the fall election if that flies . __s1__ need a pr strategy that highlights the advantages of gay unions over __bathhouse__ and gay bar __existences__ . s2 believe that a true majority of people would support civil unions but not marriage . and s2 count myself amongst that majority . actually jp so far 5 states have passed gay marriage so no not every time it is put to a vote do we lose . and how am __s1__ forcing anyone to accept gay marriage ? am __s1__ forcing these voters to attend __s1__ 's wedding or dare __s1__ say be in a marriage themselves ? and __s1__ can not agree with s2 more about changing the image of the gay community as a whole . . we are not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people running around ... what __s1__ find funny is once strait people find out how boring we really are , and how we pay taxes just like every other joe __schmo__ they 'll think nothing more of special rights lol ... but actually like __s1__ stated earlier in another thread if those unions constituted the same legal rights as married couples __s1__ would be content . which 5 states put gay marriage on the ballot and it won ? to the best of s2 's knowledge , no state that has gay marriage today has ever gotten it via the ballot . it has either been the court or legislature that has forced it on the state . the gays s2 know are as boring as mr and mrs john q. public as well , but that 's not the image that is portrayed to the general public . like s2 said , __s1__ have a pr problem . s2 think that if more gays were willing to settle for civil unions that were more equivalent to marriage , __s1__ had have an easier time gaining legal acceptance . ok maybe not the ballot ... got me there man . lol ... . maine was a close one though . and yeah we got a major pr problem big time ... and __s1__ said as long as we got the legal rights of marriage and called it __cu__ __s1__ would be cool with that . __s1__ already wear a dress and heels enough as it is ! __lmao__ jk ... . s2 hope that you , at least , shave __s1__ 's legs . __;-rrb-__ oh __s1__ do ... __lmao__ __naw__ __s1__ do n't wear a dress __s1__ would n't look good in one ...
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : washington dc ' s city council recently legalized gay marriage . people 's support of gay marriage has been growing steadily in the past ten years , and will soon be the majority opinion . five states have already legalized gay marriage . those opposed to gay marriage may view gays as promiscuous and sexual !!__deviants__!! , but most gay men are !!__assuredly__!! quite normal . civil unions will not be accepted in place of marriage , as they do not allow the same legal rights as marriage . s2 : councils and legislatures may vote in favor of gay marriage , but it has yet to be the majority vote of the people . gay marriage should be played in a positive light by its supporters , because the current public perception of gay men is that they are promiscuous and lead a `` gay lifestyle '' that is offensive . anti-gay marriage supporters will support civil unions in lieu of gay marriage , and homosexuals should be satisfied with that .

Article ->  sorry , but people have certain natural rights -- keeping people from being religious infringes on that . __s1__ is not saying businesses ca n't legally do it -- they can -- __s1__ is saying __s1__ think it 's pretty unethical . it 's easy for __s1__ to sit back and say what __s1__ are saying when __s1__ dislike religion , but this is no different than an employer telling a gay employee they ca n't express themselves as being gay on the job . one is discrimination for being gay , the other is discrimination for being religious . if __s1__ are going to be for equality , then be for equality in all cases . not just picking and choosing __s1__ 's pet issues . once again __jyoshu__ ; s2 manage a fast food __resturant__ . do __s1__ agree that s2 do not have to serve boy scouts and evangelical __christains__ ? s2 's moral beliefs are against them s2 should have the right to turn away their business . after all they go against s2 's religious beliefs so s2 can refuse to serve , or even hire them . right ? if s2 use __s1__ 's logic s2 should __beable__ to do whatever s2 want and use s2 's religious beliefs as an excuse . mistaken notion ? she said clearly '' __s1__ have worked on plenty of legislation ... we enact the will of the people '' it sounds to me like she 's a legislator . that 's certainly the way it comes across -- how could s2 possibly take that any other way ? a better analogy would be if s2 were trying to force a jewish employee , whom s2 knew was jewish , to work on his sabbath rather than being willing to work with him about that . or to suddenly tell him he has to eat a pork sandwich or something . and remember , this is a different issue than __benignly__ serving food . we are talking about a major religious issue here -- gay marriage , to religious people , is like asking them to approve most any bad thing in society s2 can think of . s2 have to take the seriousness of the religious view into account here somewhat . why ? it is not s2 's problem they have evil religious values . do they work for the state or god ? does god pay their paychecks or do the taxpayers ? they just have to sign a civil contract . so what if that person is the only person able to do marriage contracts in the area . how does the state ensure that gay people can __exersize__ their right to marriage if the only person able to perform the marriage is exempted from __perfoming__ the marriage based upon religious beliefs ? __s1__ just think s2 are viewing this the wrong way -- making it more complicated than it is . it is simply a provision that allows a person to let someone else conduct the civil ceremony if their religious beliefs do n't allow them to do it . the same idea that would allow a jewish person to pass on eating pork if it were suddenly expected for him or her to do it when it was n't before . that 's all this is -- let 's not make mountains out of __molehills__ ... yet what if there is no one else in the community ? how is the government going to ensure gay people are able to __exersize__ their rights ? well , then __s1__ guess they need to ensure someone is there that will do it as well . gee , that darn religious freedom -- messing everything up , huh ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing a seemingly pending law that would permit marriage officials to decline to conduct gay marriages if they are opposed to them on religious principals . __s1__ finds it acceptable , while s2 complains about it . __s1__ proposes that it is easy for s2 to be unsympathetic because s2 dislikes religion . __s1__ acknowledges that he considers such religious objections to be evil . he suggests that because the individual licensed to perform a marriage is paid or licensed by the state , the individual should reflect the will and choices of the state and therefore perform gay marriages despite his or her personal religious objection to them . s2 suspects that the law may result in an effective denial of gay marriage .
generated -> s1 is not saying businesses ca n't legally do it to sit back and say what s1 are saying when s1 dislike religion , but this is no different than an employer telling a gay employee they ca n't legally do it . if s1 are going to be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality in all cases that

ref_sum ->  __s1__ , a heterosexual , and s2 , a homosexual , discuss the !!__justness__!! of the legislative process , majority rule , and how the latter affects individuals and the gay community . s2 describes how the gay community is discriminated against , and !!__posits__!! that because laws regarding homosexuals impact them more directly than the general population , it is unfair to have a majority rule apply . __s1__ accuses s2 of not understanding the legal system and proposes that s2 find majority to have legislation passed , and not look to the courts to redress the discrimination . __s1__ !!__analogizes__!! that process to how slavery was abolished , and also !!__analogizes__!! the alleged oppression to the oppression that may be felt by anti-abortion advocates and child !!__molesters__!! as a result of majority rule .

Article ->  __s1__ wish . but however much __s1__ disagree with sullivan on many political issues , he 's right about that . the world did change when the mass. legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights . it may be a big change in a small state , but it is a recognition that the winds of change are blowing against homophobic bigotry . __s1__ are just going to have to get over it . the world just is n't as anti-gay as it used to be . and that means that __s1__ are going to have to accept equal rights eventually , as gay marriage . presumably __s1__ will hope than in a few years , bigots in massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality . __s1__ think you 'll be out of luck . __s1__ wish that s2 wish . do __s1__ just like to argue for the sake of being argumentative ? __s1__ have picked out the one single thing s2 said there that __s1__ could disagree with and are making an issue of it , not even willing to agree on anything else s2 said . but fine , go ahead and think this is some __world-changing__ event if it makes __s1__ feel better . well , clearly __s1__ did n't even read s2 's post . -lrb- shrug -rrb- s2 have often posted here that s2 oppose gay marriage . that means s2 oppose equal rights for gays . if s2 have changed s2 's mind , and hope that massachusetts does n't overturn gay marriage , s2 would have said so . since s2 did n't , s2 do n't . no , __s1__ said __s1__ s2 '' will hope than in a few years , bigots in massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality '' . s2 had said , very plainly , that s2 think such legislation is an __over-intrusion__ by the government . clearly __s1__ did n't read s2 's post . are s2 claiming now s2 are in favour of legal marriage for gays in massachusetts now the legislature has voted for it ? because if so , that would be a change . s2 is saying that s2 would not want an amendment put in place banning it , because that would be an __over-intrusion__ into peoples ' lives by the government . so naturally , s2 would n't want such an amendment voted into creation , either , and that 's why s2 took issue with __s1__ 's claim that s2 would . that 's been s2 's position here for as long as s2 remember . and it 's a true conservative position -lrb- as opposed to __neocon__ -rrb- , __btw__ . are s2 saying that s2 are not in favour of a government ban on gay marriage ? s2 oppose doma laws ? does that mean s2 are now , contrary to s2 's previous posts , in favour of legal recognition of gay marriage ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing a legislative action associated with a massachusetts court ruling which is favorable to gay rights . __s1__ is enthusiastic about the matter and sees it as a step in the right direction against bigotry , and a recognition that the world is not as anti-gay as it used to be , which s2 is advised to acknowledge and accept . __s1__ also accuses s2 of being inconsistent in having been on the record on the website opposing gay marriage -lrb- and !!__therefor__!! according to __s1__ being opposed to equal rights for gays -rrb- , but now also taking a position that the state should not intervene to ban gay marriage . s2 defends that position and argues it is based on conservative principles against intrusions into individual lives .
generated -> the world did change when the mass. legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights . it may be a big change in a small state , but it may be a big change in a small state , but it is a recognition that the winds of change are blowing against homophobic bigotry .

Article ->  certainly not yours . s2 should know that __s1__ am for no marriage in government . it should be left to a religious institution where it will actually mean something . the states should then go back to doing something that actually makes sense and does n't reward people like britney spears for being white trash . that is all well and good , but it is not the religious ceremony and sanction that gays are looking for . they already have that ; there are churches that perform same-sex marriages . it is the civil benefits that are at issue . are __s1__ saying __s1__ would be in favor of __foregoing__ all the legal rights and benefits __s1__ are afforded by marriage ? for example * assumption of spouse s pension * automatic inheritance * automatic housing lease transfer * bereavement leave * burial determination * child custody * crime victim s recovery benefits * divorce protections * domestic violence protection * exemption from property tax on partner s death * immunity from testifying against spouse * insurance breaks * joint adoption and foster care * joint bankruptcy * joint parenting -lrb- insurance coverage , school records -rrb- * medical decisions on behalf of partner * certain property rights * reduced rate memberships * sick leave to care for partner * visitation of partner s children * visitation of partner in hospital or prison * wrongful death -lrb- loss of consort -rrb- benefits what do s2 say ? yeah __s1__ know . __s1__ is saying that there should be a better system . for example , if had a best friend who are roommates with ... both __hetero__ for the sake of argument ... and never wish to get married then could they get some of the benefits described ? __s1__ 's uncle actually was single until he died but he had a female friend who he was best friends with ... why could n't they get some kind of benefits if they so choose ? hospital __vistiation__ rights and things of that nature are obviously the most important in this kinda situation . it just seems the single folks are the ones getting screwed over in the marriage deal but gay folks are not ? to the single folks , s2 say get married . ok , lets use that logic ... . to the gay folks __s1__ say marry a woman . bet s2 are n't happy with that if want the benefits of marriage , get married . but ought to be able to marry a person of 's choice . 's suggestion would be to marry someone s2 do n't want to me married to , that is a different thing . it is not using '' that logic '' . s2 thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you . is n't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities ? s2 am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly . s2 happen to think that 's a bad idea . people get married for many reasons , some of which s2 would feel are not good reasons , but s2 would not make it illegal to do so . s2 am talking about the right to marry a person of 's choosing .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 discuss the civil benefits of marriage and how they could or could not be extended to single people and gay people . __s1__ is initially against government being involved in the equation , but after s2 describes many of the legal rights and benefits associated with marriage , such as automatic inheritance and hospital visitation rights , __s1__ is then able to relate to the issues by considering the case of his life-long bachelor uncle , suggesting that it is single people who are discriminated against by being excluded from the marriage benefits . s2 suggests that if a single person desires the benefits of marriage , they should marry , but that they should be able to marry a person of either gender as they see fit .
generated -> s2 should know that s1 am for no marriage in government . the states should then go back to doing something that actually makes sense and does n't reward people like britney spears for being white trash . it is the civil benefits that are at issue .

Article ->  __s1__ find it curious that every time someone makes the correct assertion that aids became an epidemic in the us through the gay community , gays and their pc __apologists__ immediately try to deflect the argument and want to talk about africa . __s1__ do n't give a flying f @ # $ about how it spread in africa ; __s1__ is talking about the usa . show me that __s1__ 's assertion is inaccurate and __s1__ will apologize , but do n't join the rest of the __apologists__ in trying to change the debate . the topic is aids in the us , not africa , not asia , not the south pole . the reason we bring up africa is to knock down the reason __s1__ bring up the stats in the us . __s1__ did n't just come along and start a chat about the progression of aids in the us . __s1__ threw it out as justification for those who oppose gay rights . if __s1__ want to use it like a weapon against gays - then expect tit for tat , jp . the topic is gay marriage in the usa . what part of that topic includes africa ? please try to keep up . statements like the above make s2 look __flighty__ . its __s1__ 's logic we are __refuting__ - location is irrelevant . location sure as hell is relevant . if __s1__ tell s2 that a bus hit a bunch of people in new york , why would s2 retort with 2 buses hit a group of people in africa ? it is an obvious attempt to deflect the focus away from the first statement , is it not ? it 's not __s1__ 's logic that s2 are trying to refute , s2 are trying to deflect the topic away from how aids spread in the us . if s2 want to refute __s1__ 's statement , show me some facts , not wishes , opinions , feelings , or other means of subterfuge . i 'll say it again for you . aids reached critical mass and became an epidemic in the us primarily via the gay community . if s2 do n't agree , show proof to support the contrary . it should n't be that difficult . if __s1__ is nothing but a __gay-bashing__ bigot who makes wild claims , then surely s2 can refute __s1__ 's claim with facts pertaining to the topic in bold , ca n't you ? but , if __s1__ is actually not a __gay-bashing__ bigot and have the facts to back up __s1__ 's claim , then s2 had better continue with the subterfuge , deflection and dismissals because all s2 will have is fraudulent pc rhetoric . s2 would n't unless __s1__ were using it as justification to ban buses in new york . exactly the point s2 am trying to make to , jp . thank you .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that the gay community is the cause of the aids epidemic in the us and that homosexuals and their advocates attempt to divert attention from this fact by tracing the origin of the disease to africa . he believes that the existence of aids in africa has nothing to do with aids in the us and that it should be ignored . s2 argues that discussing aids in africa is relevant to aids in the us and point out how aids is used as a justification for those who oppose gay rights . he suggests that the statistics regarding aids in africa show that it is not simply a homosexual disease and that aids should therefore not be used as a justification to make gay marriage illegal .

'' because __s1__ am only concerned with rights of gay people . gay people are __s1__ 's first concern . this evil woman should come out and __sayshe__ is anti gay . she should come out and say she does n't want gay people to get married . she should admit that she wants gay people to remain second class citizens . why does n't she own up to her discrimination ? she wants to protect her heterosexual __privledge__ . for the record __s1__ own that statement and stand behind it . __s1__ will talk people out of attending these bible churches . __s1__ will do what __s1__ can to legally disrupt any __rundrasining__ activities they have going . __s1__ will protest their wedding ceremonies . __s1__ will protest their church services . as far as __s1__ am concerned , once they crossed over the line and started pushing for and getting laws enacted that hurt me , __s1__ 's family , __ands__ __s1__ 's people , they have no place in society . and __s1__ have yet to show why this is not a legitimate viewpoint , nor a legitimate way to legislate this issue . it 's obvious that all __s1__ care about is gay people . however , __s1__ have not shown why anti-gay -lrb- as __s1__ call them -rrb- people should not be able to legislate their view . all __s1__ have said is that __s1__ do n't like their view . big deal , they do n't like __s1__ 's view either . thus , in a democracy like ours , the majority of people decide issues like this . besides that , s2 think coming out in support of a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage qualifies as '' com -lsb- ing -rsb- out and say -lsb- ing -rsb- that she does n't want gay people to get married . '' this is fine . but also understand that it is legitimate for people who believe like ms. __musgrave__ to do the same , including to use the democratic process to have her view enacted in law . if __s1__ are free to do it , then she is as well . should the majority have the right to __enslave__ their fellow citizens ? should the majority have the right to lock people up in concentration camps ? a majority of the people in the us once thought it was a good idea . oh __s1__ want the evil woman to say it . __s1__ want her __viciousness__ and ugliness out in the open . if she is anti gay then she needs to own up to her bigotry repent america believes in protesting and disrupting gay gatherings . why if they can do this __s1__ can do the same . the majority did have the legal right -lrb- unfortunately -rrb- to __enslave__ their fellow citizens until the 13 th amendment took that option off the table . incidentally , it took a majority of people to take slavery off of the table . in the united states , the majority wins -lrb- for good or for ill -rrb- . s2 hope __s1__ are not trying to make a comparison between the denial of marriage to gays -lrb- and to 10 year olds , and to those who are currently married yet want another husband / wife , and to those who wish to marry their father , etc. -rrb- on the one hand , and slavery and / or concentration camps on the other . ok , and what would that accomplish ? yeah , that 's exactly what s2 said .

ref_sum ->  this is about gay marriage . __s1__ seems to believe that someone is making religion into law by saying marriage should be between a heterosexual couple . s2 is arguing that __s1__ 's point is not very valid because __s1__ is not understanding that they are not using the persons perspective . __s1__ believes that that person is trying to hurt them , while s2 is saying that the person may not necessarily be that way and that the person may be arguing for what they believe to be greater for society , based on their own perspective . __s1__ 's religious view of marriage is based on two people 's love for each other , while the other person believes its between a man and woman . s2 says __s1__ 's argument is empty and that __s1__ is not showing how the other person is being hurt by gay marriage . s2 thinks __s1__ is not understanding the overall perspectives and just focusing on their own needs . __s1__ states that the person 's religion put into law affects peoples ability to marry if they are gay , but that __s1__ 's religion on marriage put into law would not affect marriage for anyone .

Article ->  __lesz__ , __s1__ 's marriage means a great many things to me , none of which have anything to do with our governments . __s1__ 's question to s2 is what do __s1__ think marriage should mean to our governments ? well , marriage is an ancient human institution , based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans , and is one of the foundations of social stability . why would it surprise anyone that government might wish to support it ? what really surprises me is to find how many alleged christians now find it __expedient__ to demand government '' get out of marriage '' , simply because gay people want to get in it . bunch of hypocrites -- they never complained about government regulating marriage before this . now , while s2 agree it is n't absolutely essential for government to be involved in the regulation and support of marriage , it is nevertheless a convenience that few people would really want to throw away . -lrb- mr. __writela__ has summed it up eloquently so s2 need n't elaborate . -rrb- alas , many are just too mean-spirited to share marriage with those pesky __homos__ , so they have jumped on the __get-out-of-marriage__ bandwagon -- which is n't going to go anywhere -- as camouflage for their real feelings . that government would wish to be involved in any aspect of our lives , would not surprise me . that is what governments tend to do . consider the '' healthy marriage initiative '' . this is our government and as citizens , we would be well advised to exercise vigilance to prevent our government from __intruding__ into areas where there is no necessity . just because a few mean-spirited hypocrites may advocate that the government get out of marriage for the wrong reasons does not mean that the idea is all bad . never happen ? enlist the 100 single people who have the biggest stake in this issue and chip away at the exclusive benefits . start with an easy one like hospital visitation and work up to the tough ones like social security to spouses why ? why is it in the interests of society to prevent government involvement in marriage ? that 's what __s1__ have n't explained . __mrwritela__ pointed out the reasons that government involvement is pretty much unavoidable , if only because government is the source of law . it seems to me __s1__ advocate the replacement of marriage with a plethora of minor and specific legal contracts that would only benefit the lawyers writing them . it 's the wood and the trees . if specific laws are trees , then marriage is the forest that protects our relationships from such gales that xxxx . is there any specific advantage to looking to individual trees and ignoring the wood ? __lesz__ __s1__ ask why and s2 ask why not . why should government get out of the marriage business 1 . it is not needed 2 . the current marriage benefits are terribly unfair to single people that are forced to pay for them . __s1__ 's __eloquence__ notwithstanding , have found it useful to look very closely at the trees when solving problems . would suggest that one can not understand the wood unless one knows something about trees . also , have often found it useful to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller parts and solving the easiest parts first . why is government support of marriage unfair to single people ? single people do not have the same issues as married people . having been married and single myself , s2 do have some insight here . and why would rather married people go to lawyers for multiple legal contracts to cover all the hundreds of rights and mutual obligations currently conferred by marriage ? are a lawyer in need of clients ? __;-rrb-__ s2 's own experience of woods and trees is that there is no value in looking at them in only one way . one needs to consider them as trees and woods . __s1__ have also been single and married . experience but not much insight . __s1__ would be interested to hear s2 's views about this difference in issues and how these issues are helped by government involvement . __lesz__ , __s1__ am an engineer , not a lawyer . well , single people live by themselves , not as a family . by definition , they do not have a significant relationship -- and no , s2 do n't count boyfriends or girlfriends here , s2 am referring to committed couples who live together as a family unit . there are many legal issues such as inheritance , pension and social security rights , adoption and child custody , home ownership , etc. , which would need separate legal contracts without the umbrella of marriage . -lrb- and of course , even then such contracts would only be enforceable by government . -rrb- s2 myself had tremendous difficulties sorting out property issues with s2 's partner 's family after he died . it all but __bankrupted__ me , and there would n't have been any issue at all had it been legal for us to get married . we did have some legal contracts pertaining to the house , and wills , but alas they were n't good enough to get his family off s2 's back , because our legal relationship was trumped by his familial one . s2 am not saying it could n't be done piecemeal , tailor-made to suit each individual couple , but would n't that be excessively inconvenient -- for everyone but the lawyers ? whereas at __prresent__ , when __s1__ get married for a $ 25 license , hey presto , __s1__ get those protections and the lawyers have to defer their caribbean cruise .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are debating the topic of what marriage should mean to our government . __s1__ believes it is not a bad idea because they think it is not necessary for the government to be involved in most aspects of our lives , while s2 is questioning why it 's necessary to try and remove government involvement when it is unavoidable . __s1__ brings up that because several people are against the government due to gay marriage and not because it 's just marriage altogether , it does n't mean it 's not a bad idea to remove government intervention . __s1__ mentions the `` healthy marriage initiative '' and how it is n't necessary . s2 says that there is too much legal work and documents behind marriage in the government , such as inheritance , pension and social rights , etc. . , and that it would be a lot more work if the government did n't intervene , also stating that removing marriage from government will only benefit lawyers . both __s1__ and s2 have had experience with marriage , s2 states that marriage benefits are good because of government intervention .
generated -> marriage '' an ancient human institution , based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans , and is one of the foundations of social stability that alas , many are just too mean-spirited to share marriage with those pesky homos , so they have jumped on the get-out-of-marriage bandwagon . why is it in the interests of society to prevent government involvement in marriage ? that

Article ->  in the sense that saying one supports gay rights but not gay marriage , sure . but __s1__ have no problem with that inconsistency . however , s2 are for gay marriage , __ergo__ , it makes more sense s2 had be bothered by that inconsistency . but if not , fine . whatever ... -lrb- and yes , __s1__ know s2 have given me s2 's ' reasons ' . does n't mean there 's no inconsistency there . it just means s2 think it 's not something that should be challenged right now . -rrb- again , s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't understand why __s1__ keep saying it 's an '' inconsistency '' . it 's not a matter of it being a '' problem '' , but rather a question of why __s1__ repeatedly label it as an '' inconsistency '' . just to try to put this plainly . __s1__ and biden have both stated the same opinion . against gay marriage , but for gay rights in every other way . with __s1__ 's stated opinion statement , s2 do n't see an inconsistency . but __s1__ do see an inconsistency with __s1__ 's stated opinion statement . quite frankly , s2 really have n't seen __s1__ show an inconsistency yet . __s1__ have said '' inconsistency '' , but not show it . it 's a bit like saying '' frank is inconsistent on the abortion issue '' , but that 's it . it would be showing an inconsistency to show frank 's statement saying '' s2 am against all abortion '' , but then he has no problem with his wife getting an abortion cause she does n't want to lose her figure . nothing in his statement is '' inconsistent '' , __imo__ . if __s1__ say biden is '' inconsistent '' , __s1__ are also saying that about __s1__ 's position ... s2 know , if s2 are n't able to grasp the concept of the inconsistency of saying one is against gay marriage when saying they are for gay rights , __s1__ do n't know what else to say . it would be different if s2 did n't think gay marriage should be a right . but s2 do , so how could his position not be inconsistent to you ? to take s2 's abortion example , it would be like someone saying they are for reproductive / abortion rights , but yet being against it being legal for women to get an abortion at an abortion clinic . frankly , s2 are grasping at straws at this point . but that 's your position ... if __s1__ ca n't grasp that __s1__ are saying your own position is inconsistent , s2 do n't know what to say . yeah . __s1__ have no recollection of what s2 's position actually is , do you . as s2 have already explained to you , s2 see that a person can be for gay rights and against gay marriage . s2 see that a person can propose a compromise , that s2 personally would find acceptable . s2 ca n't tell __s1__ how many people have posted '' s2 do n't believe gay marriage is a right '' . if they also say '' s2 believe gays should have equal rights '' , there is no contradiction just cause s2 believe -lrb- let me repeat that , s2 believe -rrb- that gay marriage is a right . s2 think biden 's wrong . but his view is consistent . on another note , s2 am just amazed that __s1__ think __s1__ 's own position is inconsistent . s2 honestly had no idea ... are s2 just not reading the thread __????__ apparently not . let me repeat myself ... '' in the sense that saying one supports gay rights but not gay marriage , sure . '' __s1__ have already said __s1__ know it 's inconsistent , but that __s1__ do n't care . it 's not a pet issue for me . it is for you . yet s2 are far more concerned , it seems , about the inconsistency on __s1__ 's part than on biden 's part . yet it 's biden who 's s2 's candidate . stop the dishonesty of pretending __s1__ have n't already addressed that . actually , s2 did n't think __s1__ had recognized what __s1__ had admitted . next sentence __s1__ talked about biden ... '' more concerned '' ? s2 am arguing against the general position . it does n't matter who holds it . one of the points with biden , as explained in multiple points before , is how the perception of holding his feet to the fire could impact others ... if s2 could have a private one-on-one with biden , or if he logged on anonymously to this __web-site__ , s2 would discuss it with him just the same . quite frankly , the '' he 's our candidate '' thing is one of the things that takes precedent . see , we do n't approach these things as '' single issue '' type guys . we weigh the '' gay marriage opinion '' up against the impact of pushing him hard on it a few weeks away from election day , and balance the responding approach accordingly . s2 hear somewhere that '' single issue '' guys can be frowned upon . that ai n't us ...
ref_sum ->  it seems like they are discussing the inconsistency of each other 's arguments . __s1__ is getting annoyed and seems to just be arguing because they are `` venting '' while s2 is saying that the inconsistency is present and making all arguments invalid without proof . both __s1__ and s2 are for gay rights , s2 is stating that __s1__ is n't being consistent and `` admits '' to being inconsistent , while __s1__ is saying they do n't care about the inconsistency because of the point they are trying to get across . they bring up biden and abortion in ways that dont exactly fit the discussion , but just to show the inconsistency in each others opinions . s2 is saying they would handle this same situation with biden the exact same way because s2 is simply talking about perspective . __s1__ believes s2 is stating that __s1__ believes in gay marriage but not gay rights , which seems contradictory to __s1__ 's point . this argument does not have a set topic .
generated -> again , s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't see an inconsistency in that position . for the life of me s2 do n't mean there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency there 's no inconsistency .

Article ->  because it 's all quite clear . decades of effort from the religious right , conservative republicans , and their like have made gay rights a poisoned topic . it 's a tragedy , but saying the right thing on this issue will cost s2 more votes than it will gain you , everyone knows it , and no one is going to do it . it 's politics 101 . the democrats , as a whole , want to do the right thing , but they know that if they say so too loudly they wo n't be in a position to do anything . they are forced to moderate their public stances so that they can get into positions where they can actually take action . this is of course a __generalization__ , but if s2 are talking about a political party as a whole that 's unavoidable . so , __s1__ are basically saying that biden was lying through his teeth when he said he does n't support gay marriage ? it was all just a lie to keep from losing votes ? interesting . possibly , __s1__ could n't say . certainly as a democrat he gets more benefit of the doubt than __s1__ would give a republican when it comes to gay rights , but __s1__ have n't __plumbed__ his record enough to say for sure . and let 's be honest here , s2 do not find the idea that a politician might be lying interesting . what s2 had prefer is that the candidates be honest about their views , whether it 's popular or unpopular . but even knowing we are talking about political candidates -lrb- who may lie to get votes -rrb- , when a candidate says something is his or her view , s2 think we have to take them at what they say when they answer a question like that so directly and emphatically . otherwise , there 's little point in asking questions to begin with other than maybe watching the reaction of body language and how they would respond under pressure , and so forth . political discourse has to operate to where when a candidate gives a given view as his or her view , they are taken at their word that is their view . '' no '' ca n't mean '' yes '' and so forth . no , that 's too __niave__ an approach . we know politicians are going to tell some lies , __s1__ trust that 's a given . we , as political consumers , ca n't simply take politicians at their word . if we want to make informed decisions about candidates we need to develop the skills to make useful judgement calls about what they are saying . we need to figure out how often they lie , what they lie about , how big their lies are . obviously we should n't need to do this , it would be great if we could actually take our politicians at their word . bad the sad reality is that we ca n't , not at this stage anyway . in this particular case , if biden says he does n't support gay marriage __s1__ is just as likely to think it 's because he knows that open support could cost him the white house as any other reason . it 's sad that such double speak is needed , __s1__ had love it if enough courageous politicians stood forth and ended the political need for lies , but until that wonderful day __s1__ is not going to be naive and take everything they say at their word , nor am __s1__ going to jump up and down and point fingers at every __falsehood__ . i 'll try to judge the politicians by their actions , and their lies by their magnitude , scope , and quantity . s2 think __s1__ are misunderstanding me -- s2 do n't mean s2 think we should assume they are going to always tell the truth -- s2 mean we should put the expectation on them to be honest . __iow__ , honesty is what we should demand . if we are n't even going to do that , there 's no point in ever asking a political candidate a direct question . knowing they are going to lie is n't the same as having the expectation on them to be honest . s2 really do n't think it 's too much to ask our candidates to say what their views are . __s1__ just said yourself '' we need to figure out how often they lie , what they lie about , how big their lies are '' so , obviously , __s1__ believe it 's not really good that they are lying . there would be little point in asking them questions if we are n't going to hold to them to some level of expectation that they are going to say what they mean . sure , they lie , but if the words of politicians mean nothing , there 's little point in even having political discourse . political cynicism is no excuse to not put expectations on our candidates to be honest with the american people .
ref_sum ->  this is about politics and whether or not the lie in order to get more votes . __s1__ believes politicians sometimes may lie as long as its what is the majority , while s2 is saying that s2 is more concerned with the honesty of the candidates rather than whether they are lying or not . s2 says we should expect them to be honest , because that is what we should want from politicians . __s1__ argues that politicians seem to lie in order to get the position they want or sway people to become popular , while s2 thinks that we should rely on them to make the right decision . __s1__ seems to think that s2 is making an argument for their belief , but s2 is just trying to be honest and show the other perspective . they argue about politicians lying through discussing when politicians are asked questions and how they answer them . s2 finishes by telling __s1__ we should not label politicians and expect them to do and say the right , honest thing .
generated -> conservative republicans say the right thing on this issue will cost s2 more votes than it will gain you , everyone knows it , and no one is going to do it . it 's politics 101 , but if s2 are talking about a political party as a whole that 's unavoidable . so , s1 are basically saying that biden was lying through his teeth when he said he does n't support gay marriage ?

Article ->  well ... so far eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue have found that barring same-sex marriage is unconstitutional . we are waiting to hear about three or four more . as for the nature of marriage , it is both a legal contract and -lrb- sometimes -rrb- a religious ceremony -lrb- sacrament in some religions -rrb- . we are stuck with the __duality__ , whether we like it or not , and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect . different religions can do what they want . they found that it violated their state __constitutions__ , right ? this has nothing to do with the us constitution . the winning arguments were based largely on state constitutional provisions that closely parallel , if not outright __mimmick__ , the federal constitution . that 's not generally true , is it ? for example , the massachusetts ruling was based on a specific provision in the mass. constitution that prohibits discrimination based on sexual preference . there 's nothing like that in the us constitution . and s2 's overall point was that we should be careful when calling something '' unconstitutional '' , in that we should be clear it we are talking state or federal constitution . many state __constitutions__ guarantee rights that are n't in the __fedral__ constitution . there 's nothing like that in the mass. . constitution either . though , it 's a __darned__ good idea ! goodrich was decided on equal protection grounds , citing the mass. document . __s1__ had have to look up the others to see the exact reasoning , but they are not likely to be far afield from the bedrock principles of equal protection and due process . gay rights is a real test of our constitutional system , and , so far , we are not passing with flying colors ... __s1__ are right , s2 __misremembered__ . it 's just __descrimination__ based on sex that 's banned .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing the issue of marriage equality . both subjects seem to be on the fence with the issue . __s1__ cites that eight of nine supreme courts have contended same sex marriage to be unconstitutional . s2 questions how gay marriage would violate someone 's constitutional rights . __s1__ advises the bulk of the arguments were based on state __constitutions__ which mirror the federal constitution . s2 uses the example of massachusetts ' allowing gay marriage under its state constitutional law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation . __s1__ contends there is no such piece to the massachusetts constitution . s2 then concedes he was incorrect about the citing and the law actually banned only discrimination based on gender and not sexual orientation .
generated -> marriage , it is both a legal contract and -lrb- sometimes -rrb- a religious ceremony -lrb- sacrament in some religions -rrb- , whether we like it or not , and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect . the winning arguments were based on state constitutional provisions that closely parallel , if not outright mimmick , the federal constitution .

Article ->  it would lead ultimately down the road to a marriage bill for __polygamists__ . that is why the current push for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage also contains a provision banning polygamous marriage as well . hmm ... . some opposition to the petition ... more left wing ideology at work . if the man after god s own heart had multiple wives , why can t i ? have heard others say that we already have polygamy in america . it s called serial polygamy because of our liberal divorce laws . so now those that are opposed to even more laws on the books and a return to old testament practices are considered left wing ? what s this world coming too ? lol king david having multiple wives was under old testament practice . jesus himself stated that divorce laws were granted by moses and allowed by god because of the __hardness__ of the people hearts . jesus said a man shall leave his father and mother and be __cleaved__ to his wife , not wives . __btw__ , its called serial __monogamy__ . if its ' right wing ' to support a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage than its ' left wing ' to oppose a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage . so is it a sin or just a practice ? s2 don t remember jesus saying polygamy was wrong . the statement __s1__ referred to does indicate that he was talking about a single wife , but s2 __wouldn__ t base a whole social convention on one word out of a whole book . anyway the jews don t believe in the new testament . would it be okay for them ? man s2 screwed that one up . s2 ll try to be a little more articulate in the future . okay was just wondering . base 's wing on what think is correct , not left or right . a few years ago it was right wing to be against the deficit , now it seems to be left wing . but that just shows what know about wings . lol the idea that it is now left wing to be against deficits is absurd . numerous democrats actually wanted to spend more than the bush administrations 12.5 % increase in federal spending . s2 was basing that on __s1__ 's previous statement in other words , anything that is opposed to one wing must be the opposite so s2 don t see how it s absurd unless __s1__ want to call __s1__ 's original statement absurd . this is obviously not the thread for this discussion but s2 will reply this time and see where it takes us . __s1__ __didn__ t state what __s1__ considered to be numerous nor did __s1__ supply anything to back up that statement . however deficits depend on both increased spending and lower revenues . bush has done both with large tax cuts and large discretionary spending increases . and even the conservatives are beginning to criticize him for being a big spending president . over the past 23 years , conservative administrations have increased the deficits and liberal administrations have decreased the deficits . so yeah it looks to me like left wing is against deficits and right wing is for deficits .
ref_sum ->  two people are debating the topic of gay marriage rights . __s1__ believes allowing gays to marry will open up the door to legalize other types of marriage such as polygamy . s2 holds to the theory that if king david was able to have multiple wives , why then should the common man not be able to , especially if religion is to now be the basis for all laws . __s1__ contends that practice was of the old testament and is no longer considered commonplace . s2 feels __s1__ is too left wing to entertain the thought of allowing gay marriage , but uses religion as the basis even though there are so many contradictions between the old testament and what is considered the new testament .
generated -> some opposition to the petition ... more left wing ideology at work . if the man after god s own heart had multiple wives , why can t i ? have heard others say that we already have polygamy in america that

Article ->  __s1__ think a better comparison is __sodom__ ... . these are the comments that make __s1__ a homophobic bigot , not __s1__ 's opposition to gay marriage . in s2 's mind yes ... . when s2 have bath houses in sf that have 100 men in a daisy chain performing unprotected sex on one another __s1__ would make the comparison to __sodom__ ... . that is not homophobic , that is a fact and s2 should condemn it too ... . so , __s1__ have been there to see this s2 take it or are __s1__ going on rumors and misinformation . did __s1__ read about this on the focus on family website ? sorry , s2 just do n't believe you . go to yahoo and do a search on san francisco gay bath houses if s2 do n't believe me ... . when the aids first came out they were shut down but they are flourishing again now and the occupants have gone back to unprotected sex ... . from what __s1__ have surmised s2 are gay . __s1__ am surprised s2 did not know that ... . you made a very specific claim about 100 men in a daisy chain having unprotected sex . it is clear to me that post was not based in fact , but opinion . if __s1__ do n't have the proof of the claim , __s1__ should n't make it ! that is what makes __s1__ a __homophobe__ . __s1__ make claims about gays without knowing the truth . why do s2 think they closed the bath houses down in the eighties ? this , at last check is 2005 , what they did in the 80 's has nothing to do with the topic at hand , or __s1__ 's comments . so either justify __s1__ 's comments or take them back and admit they were __uncalled__ for ... joe s2 need to read the link __s1__ cited in a post in this thread ... . gays in sf are trying to get the bath houses reopened ... . great ! what does that have to do with gay rights ? what does it have to do with the title of this thread ? how can __s1__ take what a small group of gays in california are doing and equate it to the behaviors of all gays . that is irresponsible .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ is against gay rights apparently because of the biblical story of __sodom__ , and the sexual activities __s1__ perceives to have occurred in san francisco bath houses , which __s1__ asserts the current gay community is trying to re-open . he argues that the gay community is going back to unprotected sex and that a daisy chain of 100 men perform unprotected sex on each other in the bath houses . s2 challenges the assumptions , specifically finding the daisy chain of 100 men a less than credible assertion and !!__admonishes__!! __s1__ to use facts to support his arguments , not opinions . s2 also notes that __s1__ 's apparent fascination with bath houses is not relevant to the gay rights topic under which the posts are being entered .

ref_sum ->  prior to this dialog , s2 apparently likened the gay marriage movement to the civil rights movement of the african american community . __s1__ is offended by the alleged analogy , finding a material distinction between race and sexual orientation . she suggests that to view it otherwise would be an insult to all african americans . s2 points out that two presumably prominent african american figures , !!__corretta__!! scott king and __jullian__ bond , are !!__pro-gay__!! marriage . __s1__ questions whether they do in fact support gay marriage , and s2 provides links to support his assertion . __s1__ accepts the evidence and concedes that some african americans may not be as insulted by the analogy and wonders how martin luther king felt about the issue of gay marriage .

Article ->  agreed , when the husband is part of a __hetero__ relationship . gay husband is not a legally recognized category . agreed , when the wife is part of a __hetero__ relationship . gay wife is not a legally recognized category . agreed , when the spouse is part of a __hetero__ relationship . gay spouse is not a legally recognized category . so the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem . what is the reason it 's not legally recognized ? because the couple is gay . where do __s1__ get the figure of 500,000 gay couples who want to immediately be married ? would these gay couples beat the straight couples in some kind of a race to the weddings occurring at the same time , or occurring over the course of a month or a year ? they are not legally recognized because they do n't meet the legal criteria for marriage , ie one man , one woman . a cat does n't meet the legal definition of a dog . do we change the definition of dog to appease the cat ? that 's the real question to be answered by society . actually , __s1__ pulled the number out of the air for __illustrative__ purposes only , but after reading the cbo report , __s1__ see that __s1__ was n't far off . they predicted 600,000 gay couples would want to get married it allowed . this is circular reasoning however . it 's stating that marriage simply is heterosexual , and so completely ends debate . exactly __s1__ 's point , just as a cat can never be considered a dog just because someone wants it to be . to me , and __s1__ is guessing millions of others , the term gay marriage is an __oxymoron__ . that 's not to say that we should n't consider the possibility of allowing gay unions with , possibly , equivalent rights to __hetero__ couples if we , as a society , see the benefit in doing so . for example , prior to fdr , the concept of state welfare was considered ludicrous and unconstitutional , but he was able to get enough support -lrb- and enough political muscle -rrb- to change society 's mind on the role of the federal gov ' t once he demonstrated the '' good '' that doing so had on america in its most dire time of need . people were willing to sacrifice a little freedom for security just as ben franklin had warned against . now , i 'll be the first to tell s2 that __s1__ think fdr was the biggest threat to american freedom that ever existed , but one ca n't argue his ability to change public opinion on the role of the federal gov ` t . it concerns reason , as __jaxian__ said earlier . what are the logical reasons for marriage discrimination against gays and lesbians ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ does not believe that anyone outside of a heterosexual marriage should be considered a husband , wife or a spouse because legally they are not . this person believes that the term gay marriage is an __oxymoron__ because marriage , legally , to them , is only between one man and one woman . they believe that prior to roosevelt , society did not accept the idea of state welfare as constitutional , but because people were willing to sacrifice freedom for security , they eventually caved to his ideas . s2 does not believe that marriage is simply between one man and one woman , and that the entire reason behind the debate is so that homosexual marriage can and will be legally recognized . they do not see a reason for discrimination against homosexual marriage .
generated -> s1 pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only , but after reading the cbo report , s1 see that s1 was n't far off . it 's stating that marriage simply is heterosexual , and so completely ends debate that

ref_sum ->  __s1__ does not believe that most christians are trying to ban homosexual unions , and that those accusing them of doing so are doing so falsely . they believe that homosexual lobbyists have gone beyond being defensive and are actively attempting to attack evangelical !!__christiandom__!! falsely in order to justify their arguments . s2 believes that the majority of __self-identified__ christians in the united states in fact , do oppose civil unions for homosexual citizens . however , they point out that in other countries such as spain , they might not , but in general , the belief is the same globally . they refute __s1__ 's claims that they are not trying to ban homosexual unions by pointing out that the state constitutional amendments being passed are intended to preclude same-sex marriage and civil unions .

Article ->  the divorce rate in the u.s. is really blown out of proportion by high rate of very young people __whjo__ get divorced ... . the percentage of people getting divorces who have been married over 5 years drops dramatically ... . um , young people and young marriages really are n't the same thing . there are those young people who actually do stay together past those first five years . the truth of the matter is that couples in general who divorce do so more often within the first five years , regardless of age . the point was and still is , that heterosexual marriages end in divorce nearly 50 % of the time . end of story . __s1__ can try to pretty it up all __s1__ want , it does n't change the fact that __s1__ __heteros__ are no better at staying together than __s1__ expect us gays / lesbians to . of course there are but a lot of young people get married and realize it was a mistake and get divorced ... . yeah , so ? there are a lot of older people who get married and realize the same thing and get divorced ... all within the same five year time period . one does not really have a lot to do with the other . nor does it change the fact that more than half of all marriages end in divorce . period , end of story , no __nit-picking__ ... -lcb- just remember these marriages still only are consisted of __heterosexuals__ ... -rcb- yes but because of the high rate of young people that get divorced it throws the percentage off ... . statistics prove by a wide majority that gays in general are much more promiscuous then __straights__ ... . __s1__ are completely off base read this ; try reading actual census data can not compare gay to straight promiscuity within the context of a '' marriage '' when only __straights__ are legally allowed to get married . it 's obvious the data will be skewed , any idiot could see that . __http__ ca n't compare marriage but __http__ can compare relationships ... . read the articles before __s1__ shoot off __s1__ 's mouth . __s1__ very rarely read propaganda be it from the right or the left ... . so now data from the census bureau is now '' propaganda ? '' what a riot ! no one can actually know what percentage of the population of the u.s. is gay ... . if s2 throw out the lesbians it would be about 2 percent ...
ref_sum ->  __s1__ believes that the divorce rate in the united states is blown out of proportion by the rate of very young people who get divorced and states that the percentage of people who have been married over five years drops dramatically . they also believe that homosexuals are more promiscuous than __heterosexuals__ . s2 believes that young people and young marriages are n't really the same thing , and that the real facts are that those who divorce do so more often within the first five years of marriage , regardless of age . they refute __s1__ 's argument by pointing out that heterosexual marriages still end in divorce around 50 % of the time . they do n't believe that homosexual relationships should compare to heterosexual marriages because only __heterosexuals__ are legally allowed to marry .

Article ->  __s1__ 's __apologizies__ . __s1__ read it hastily and got it completely __bassackwards__ . the cbo estimate in 's link did , indeed , say that the result would be up to ~ $ 1 billion surplus . so __s1__ also recognize that __s1__ 's argument that same-sex marriage does not benefit society is also '' __bassackwards__ '' ? finally ! some progress . remember ... this thread is supposed to be about fiscal concerns . __s1__ have conceded that it does n't have the negative financial impact that __s1__ thought it would . that was the purpose for __s1__ 's attempting to have a civil debate on what __s1__ thought the issues were . __s1__ had like to move past the fiscal concerns and onto the moral and health concerns if we can continue to do s2 with civility . gosh , s2 love a good typo ! in any case , s2 suppose a tepid concession is all we can expect . good catch . and s2 were hoping for ... ? a forthright concession . any maybe some discussion of how same-sex marriage benefits society in practical ways . instead , we are off to __s1__ 's safe ground of '' morality '' . safe , not because __s1__ are right , but because morality is relative and is subjective . __s1__ was hoping that s2 had be telling me the benefits , not vice versa . but s2 forget , __s1__ is not one of '' those '' who feels the need to impose __s1__ 's morality on everyone else . __s1__ is more than willing to let society as a whole determine its own limits . while __s1__ is a staunch defender of the constitution -lrb- as written , not as interpreted -rrb- , __s1__ is way more flexible with public determined acceptable standards of behavior . i 'll even cut __s1__ 's grass so that it is the same level as __s1__ 's neighbors .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ concedes that there would be little financial impact on support for homosexual marriage , and would in fact supply a surplus . however , this person still desires a debate on moral and health concerns of the issue . they do not view themselves as someone who imposes their moral beliefs on others , and is willing to let society determine its own limits . while they vocally defend the united states constitution as written , they also desire to be more flexible with public determined acceptance of behavior . s2 would like to see this concession as a means to lead to a discussion on the societal benefits of same-sex marriage , however , they believe that __s1__ is attempting to hide behind their moral grounds because __s1__ sees it as relative and subjective .
generated -> s1 's apologizies read it does n't have the negative financial impact that s1 's argument that same-sex marriage does not have the negative financial impact that s1 's argument that same-sex marriage does not have the negative financial impact that s1 thought the issues were .

Article ->  should they ? what are western standards ? what were they 20 yrs ago ? what were they 100 yrs ago ? marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract . where would that put families started by artificial insemination ? the same as any other heterosexual couple . it 's not the way children are created -lrb- adopted , __serrogacy__ , etc -rrb- . it ' s the nature of the relationship -lrb- heterosexual -rrb- . natural refers to nature not child bearing . which god enforces marriage rules when the __cermony__ is __performend__ by a judge ? there was a tribe in the congo that allowed it . their __shamans__ told them that the warriors could only marry outer warriors . to be with a women , they thought , might make then softer , and more woman like , and not as fearless in combat . ok , so conceiving a child is not what makes it nature , what is it ? __wouldn__ t polygamy also include some of that same sex taboo , to women marred together ? why do __s1__ feel __s1__ 's values are right and others that disagree as wrong ? polygamy is not women married together . it 's one man or women married to multiple of the opposite sex like a harem or entourage . everyone feels their values are right or else they would n't believe in them . what we value shows . of course atheist do n't believe in god so they have a different set of values . __s1__ of course believe in god first , family second , and country third . if s2 have different values then of course s2 will think yours are better if not then s2 would n't have them . our values are what guide us . __s1__ feel that from perspective __s1__ 's values give someone a better balance and stability to function in society . s2 probably think otherwise but __s1__ feel statistically __s1__ can support mine . sorry , s2 don t practice polygamy ; s2 don t know the inner workings of the family . s2 would think it would be a good way for __bi-sexual__ to stay below the radar . s2 worded the question badly ; s2 should have asked why do __s1__ feel that __s1__ 's morals should be forced on to others ? by keeping the laws the way they are now it is discrimination . correct me if s2 am wrong , but s2 did not think __s1__ could fire some one for being gay . it 's all good __s1__ did n't think s2 knew what s2 were talking about __anyways__ ? the questions is why should they force their moral on us ? should we let other people like nudist and rapist force their __mroals__ on us ? how is allowing them to marry forcing there morals on us ? yes we would have to deal with the fact of it , but the us has been dealing with the fact of polygamy fro years . there is only one case that was prosecuted in recent history -lrb- that was mostly due to one of his wives being 14 when married . when society __legalizes__ behavior it is in fact accepting it as __non-detrimental__ and accepting it . it is a form of forcing our society to accept the behavior .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ makes the claim that marriage is defined as a family unit based on natural heterosexual contact , and suggests that it is the heterosexual nature of the relationship that is important , not how the children are conceived within the relationship . he argues that homosexuals are attempting to force their morals on others by legalizing same-sex marriage , claiming that legalizing a behavior is a tacit form of acceptance that will affect society . s2 questions the religious basis of a civil ceremony like marriage , suggesting that the !!__stipulations__!! based on religious reasons would vary depending on the chosen religion . he also compares homosexuality to polygamy , claiming that polygamy has been unofficially accepted for years , and argues that maintaining the current same-sex marriage bans should be considered discriminatory .
generated -> marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract . where would that put families started by artificial insemination ? the same as any other heterosexual couple . which god enforces marriage rules when the cermony is performend by a judge ? there was a tribe in the congo that the warriors could only marry outer warriors .

Article ->  we do n't just benefit from what is often considered the common , nuclear family . we benefit from families with adopted children , step children , families with no children at all . no it does not . prove it will come up , and also prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . marriage is that now . s2 are right , it has nothing to do with the bible . it has everything to do with the slippery slope logical __fallacy__ , which we have discussed in the forum ad __nauseum__ . it only shows that those opposed do not have an argument . s2 know the prospect of incest and polygamy is much less socially acceptable than gay marriage , so s2 try to erroneously tie polygamy and incest to gay marriage in people 's mind to strike fear in them , and hope their logical reasoning can be replaced by irrational fear . a married couple as the head of a home is considered a nuclear family it already has . the question of legality is what this whole issue is about . marriage is a legal __instituation__ , how could legality not come up . yes it is whoa ... hold up ... are __s1__ saying that only because gay marriage is less unacceptable that incestuous relations , that its ok to grant gay marriage but not sibling marriage ?? if the incestuous society begin to parade and protest , until society accepts them on the level that they accept gays now , what will __s1__ say then ? on what grounds should we discriminate against 2 siblings wanting to get married , particularly if they believe they truly love each other , or if they believe that they were born with that attraction ? this is classic __hypocracy__ . if 2 siblings want to love each other in their private lives , how is that any business of yours ? and what does irrational fear have to do with anything ? do __s1__ have an irrational fear of an incestuous or polygamous lifestyle ? based on what ? give me one reason why society __shouldnt__ accept an incestuous relation between two consenting adults then what may lead to incest and polygamy is the fact that marriage is a legal institution , is that what s2 are saying ? if so , these things may come up equally as a result of straight legal marriage or gay legal marriage or interracial legal marriage , or legal __inter-faith__ marriage or legal marriage with legal divorce , etc. . it does n't relate specifically to gay legal marriage at all . __s1__ was saying this is how many people attempt an argument against gay marriage , by attempting to incite fear by spouting off a parade of __horribles__ that have nothing to do with the issue of gay marriage . what if straight people are married and winged green monkeys come flying out of everyone 's derriere in the future ? what will s2 do then ? demonstrate how gay marriage specifically relates to incest and incestuous marriage and polygamy . this is the gay rights forum , not the incest forum . thats not what im saying . what may lead to incestuous marriage is if siblings or related people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . and what may lead to polygamous marriage is 3 or more people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage . do __s1__ see a pattern here ? __ooooh__ . . nice way to snake out of the issue ... let me refresh __s1__ 's memory since __s1__ brought it up , what exactly does the social acceptance of any type of '' taboo '' relationship have to do with their right to be legally married ? is there a certain limit of '' __tabooness__ '' , and if __youre__ past that limit then no marriage for you ? and what fear are __s1__ talking about ? s2 is talking about people that love each other and want to tie the knot . how could that possibly strike fear in somebody ? please ... . yes , that 's true . yes , that 's true . are s2 saying love is the pattern ? well , love applies to straight marriages as well as gay marriages . love is not exclusive to gay marriages . if that 's the connection , we can just as easily say straight marriage will lead to incestuous marriage and polygamy . s2 are saying love will cause a slippery slope . it 's still __fallacious__ . the issue __s1__ brought up was why this __fallacy__ is often used , that is to create fear , because incest and polygamy are indeed considered so taboo . the issue is not the __tabooness__ of anything and everything , but how it is being used to distract from the issue of same-sex marriage , when there is n't a logical , rational argument against same-sex marriage . it 's an indication of desperation on the part of some of those who are against same-sex marriage . __s1__ have no reason to discuss the level of __acceptability__ or lack thereof of every single thing , before __s1__ accept one thing that is different from all those other things . __s1__ can deal with that one thing on all of its own merits and shortfalls , without being drawn into a false dilemma , either accept everything or else do n't accept one thing , as if those are the only two choices , __fallacy__ . gay marriage will change the definition of marriage from '' a legal union between a man and a woman '' to '' a legal union between any parties that love each other '' . if its ok for 2 people that love each other and want to tie the knot , then how could incest be a taboo ? based on what ? again with the double standard . gay marriage was considered just as much a taboo as incest or polygamy just a few years ago . being gay emerged from its taboo status through parades , promotional efforts , and , unfortunately , by spreading lies -lrb- i 'll deal with that in another thread -rrb- . however , incestuous people __didnt__ go through the process of parading their lifestyle in front of the world and practically begging for approval from society . so incest is still deeper in taboo status than homosexuality . why is it ok to deny incestuous relations the right to marry on the grounds that it is considered taboo , but ok to approve gay marriage on the same grounds ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are debating whether making gay marriage legal will open opportunities for other `` taboos '' in our society . __s1__ believes that in opening this opportunity for gay marriage , the definition of marriage will change and it will allow other issues like incest and polygamy to become legal . s2 accuses __s1__ of __hypocracy__ . in a sense , they believe gay marriage will have a sort of domino effect for other issues . __s1__ is arguing that using these other issues to be evidence for why !!__gay-marriage__!! should n't be allowed is not a valid argument . then __s1__ goes on to say that this tactic is used to instill fear to those who do not support those other issues . __s1__ understands the other issues , but does n't see the relationship between those and that of same-sex marriage . s2 keeps arguing that it __shouldnt__ be different figuring out whether one can approve gay marriage but not incest since they believe the two to be somewhat related .
generated -> prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . marriage is that now , and prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage . it has everything to do with the slippery slope logical fallacy , which we have discussed in the forum ad nauseum .

Article ->  matt , this is getting ridiculous . s2 made an assertion that republicans would send gays to concentration camps like the germans did in the holocaust . then s2 brought up a statement by paul cameron , as if paul cameron has anything to do whatsoever with republican politics or leadership . now if s2 had linked someone in the republican leadership saying those things , s2 might have something , but s2 did n't . paul cameron is a psychologist that has gone over the top at times with some of the things he 's said about gays and has paid a price for it . he 's a frequent target of the gay pride movement for __demonization__ and because he did n't tow the line with the apa 's political stances , they distanced themselves from him . __s1__ do n't agree with everything he says either , for that matter . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking ; the most s2 can say is that they are paul cameron talking . well , sure -- anything could happen . a military coup could take place and we had have martial law . a new ice age could start in the next year . an asteroid could be on its way to hit earth . but there 's a big difference between possibility and likelihood . paul cameron is the single most frequently quoted '' expert '' cited by the gop in all their attempts to limit the rights of gay people . his '' research '' has been entered in the congressional record countless times . it really is astounding that anyone would have anything to do with him . including you . what price ? without his revolting beliefs and __star-power__ , he had be flipping burgers somewhere . instead , he 's raking in a fortune speaking to the '' moral '' groups __s1__ are constantly defending . he was dismissed from the group for conducting fraudulent research . cameron talking ... gop repeating . seriously , __jyoshu__ , the man called for extermination . how can __s1__ support him or cite him or defend him at all __??????__ how can s2 not stay on point ? unless cameron is a part of the gop __leadeship__ , matt is pulling some wild point out of his hat , saying that because someone who may not even be a republican hates gays , that republicans hate gays . __s1__ might as well have said that since john lennon attacked religion , then democrats hate religion . yes , his comments are that ludicrous . this is not about paul cameron no matter how much s2 had love to change the subject , it 's about matt 's ridiculous __generalizations__ and comments . oh , and s2 need to get up with the times -- no national political party has used cameron 's information in a serious way in a long time . __s1__ is sure you 'll now be googling to try and find republican individuals out there on the internet citing cameron , but that 's not the party leadership or its platform . there is no republican in leadership that would call for the extermination of gays , and s2 know it . nor does the platform say so . so let 's put that little lie to bed right now . sorry , sir . since __s1__ did n't stay on point , s2 thought others were just as free to wander . if democratic legislators from sea to shining sea quoted lennon 's lyrics about '' imagine no religion '' at every session that talked about religious freedom , __s1__ might draw that conclusion , no ? __ooops__ . s2 thought it was about a conservative democrat in minnesota bragging about '' inside information '' from that state 's supreme court . uh ... how about the president of the united states ??? paul cameron 's research is cited in virtually every single attack on gay people in state after state after state legislature . it was presented in the '' debate '' about same-sex marriage in the u.s. __friggin__ ' senate . his name appears in the citations of virtually every legal brief filed by opponents of same-sex marriage . __http__ think he even made it into lawrence v. texas . the man is president of the family research institute . he can probably phone up ol ' __dubya__ anytime he gets the urge . and __dubya__ will put down his pretzel and pick up the phone . what should be put to bed is paul cameron and every single bogus study related to him . that supposedly reasonable people would even mention his name is surprising . ok , __s1__ now realize something __s1__ did n't earlier -- that __http__ are obviously a dnc __shill__ . no one else would make such a ridiculous __generalization__ . __http__ really do think that 's all conservatives talk about , huh ? __s1__ hate to bust __http__ 's bubble , but it 's not . __s1__ know __http__ 's martyr complex is important to you , but it 's just not accurate . -lrb- shrug -rrb- what are __s1__ talking about ? s2 said __s1__ had probably be right to assume that some people were __anti-religion__ if they consistently talked about what a wonderful world it would be without it ? over and over . at every opportunity . and never had a single nice word to say about it . ever . __s1__ really are laughable when __s1__ try to defend the gop when one of their admittedly most effective propaganda campaigns is to rally the '' __family-values__ '' crowd against gay rights . it 's openly admitted by them . they are proud of their tactics . very odd ...
ref_sum ->  this seems to be an argument about gay rights and !!__generalizing__!! the political beliefs of people . according to __s1__ , s2 talks about paul cameron and makes it seem as if he is the voice of the republicans . __s1__ argues that it is not the case and one person who sides with a specific party does n't represent the party . __s1__ uses john lennon as an example of this not being a proper way to !!__generalize__!! political views of parties , in his case the democratic party . __s1__ accuses s2 of making an assertion including the republicans creating another holocaust , because of the !!__generalization__!! that s2 made . s2 believes that paul cameron 's views are cited and used in many cases against gay rights because most people do share the same views , which __s1__ thinks otherwise . s2 says that most attacks on gay rights have cited paul cameron , even within the us senate , showing that he has a strong opinion in the republican party , or at least it seems so .
generated -> is a psychologist that has gone over the top at times with some of the things he 's said about gays and has paid a price for that matter . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking ; the most s2 can say is that they are paul cameron talking . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking ; the most s2 can say is that they are paul cameron talking . but regardless of his views , they are n't the republican party talking .

ref_sum ->  this debate is about the 9th and how the federal constitution applies to marriage . __s1__ and s2 begin by talking about trolling and potentially starting a new debate on abortion , which does n't really have a lot of purpose in this conversation . s2 says that in saying people who want to get rid of gay marriage may have wanted to prevent __inter-racial__ and inter religious marriage . s2 states that maine 's vote on gay marriage was an opinion on gay marriage , rather than the 9th being how the federal constitution applies to gay marriage . s2 also says that bowers justice stevens does n't have the evidence to withstand his analysis . they also bring up lawrence v. texas and s2 states that even when majority wants a law it is n't enough for the constitution challenge of the law . s2 goes back to saying how __s1__ 's arguments are flawed and that its too repetitive for this conversation , because __s1__ has n't disproved anything . they go back to talking trash to each other and they end the conversation .

Article ->  s2 do know that the gay marriage debate is not synonymous with someone condoning violence against gays , right ? __s1__ seriously doubt anyone here does n't agree with s2 that gays should n't experience violence and name-calling , so that 's not even an issue on the table here . disagree and debate those who believe gay marriage is wrong all s2 want . but do n't dishonestly use arguments about violence , because no one here has argued for that . s2 is sorry , but have __s1__ read archie 's posts ??? he regularly __denigrates__ gays with a variety of slurs . and palin never asked for somebody to threaten obama either . but her rhetoric inflamed people to extremes that are grotesque . oh please . do n't start that subjective __canard__ again . if every religious person who genuinely disagreed with gay marriage because of their religion added a ' __but-no-violence__ ! ' __addendum__ to __everytime__ they weighed in on it , do s2 think anyone actually thinks s2 had be satisfied ? um ... no . it 's funny how the whole violence thing gets used as a __means-to-an-end__ tool by those who argue against religious people on this . well , it would be funny if it were n't sad to some extent . people should n't have to stop standing up for their principles just because of __nutcases__ out there . if the shoe fits ... s2 is talking about the people who proclaim abusive lies about gays . people who put out junk that makes people feel threatened by gays . telling people that gay marriage will makes their kids have to be taught about gay marriage ? that 's a threat . telling people that gay marriage will require churches to have to perform gay marriages ? that 's perceived as a threat too . s2 have no doubt that some people can discuss the subject without inciting . but on the prop 8 battle , the ads clearly were __inciteful__ . do __s1__ think that if a person talks about an abortion doctor '' killing babies '' , that does n't push somebody to think about claiming '' self-defense '' or '' defense of others '' ? how many people do __s1__ think are out there that have attacked a gay person that actually had somebody tell them '' s2 think __s1__ should go out and kill a gay person '' ? it 's built up toxicity from all the anti-gay rhetoric that reaches a boiling point . when the rhetoric __inflames__ , it 's obvious where it starts when somebody gets burned ... oh . and can s2 just say that while s2 am impressed __s1__ did n't try to attack me , __s1__ are doing a bad job of ignoring me ... yeah , when it fits . not other contexts . jason did n't make that distinction which is why __s1__ took issue with him on it . __s1__ did n't say __s1__ was going to start ignoring you , __foundit__ . __s1__ made clear __s1__ was done with that discussion . __s1__ did not say __s1__ was going to stop responding to s2 __foundit__ . and regarding s2 's comment about ' attacking ' , it 's because s2 's tone has changed in the last few posts -- s2 have turned off the hostility some , for __whatver__ reason , and it 's the nature of things that honey draws less flies than **** . that 's why s2 no longer perceive as being '' attacked . '' quite simply , s2 require a __fight-fire-with-fire__ approach , and so tone s2 are treated with -lrb- from me , anyway -rrb- depends entirely on you . and considering he was responding to archie , one of the guys who has got the worst track record on this message board for abusive slurs towards gays , s2 think he was right on track . oh . silly me . so that was just a lame attempt to dodge that conversation then . the one where s2 had just finished explaining how __s1__ were moving the __goal-posts__ and __obfuscating__ up a storm . s2 guess '' __clafclo__ '' was more successful than s2 thought . it 's amusing to watch __s1__ turn on __s1__ 's __passive-aggressive__ claims , and then turn them off again . when __s1__ need it as an excuse , you 'll start whining about '' attacks '' again , even as __s1__ drop claims that s2 should n't be a moderator of any board ... which s2 is sure is n't an '' attack '' or '' personal information '' in __s1__ 's book , hmmm ? and also , __s1__ 's response here is doing exactly what s2 noted on the other thread . __s1__ are dropping the majority of the topical text , and making more of an interest in that one __side-note__ comment ... __s1__ said __namecalling__ and violence , __foundit__ . those were the things jason __conflated__ with opposing gay marriage . once again s2 are being disingenuous again -- respond to what __s1__ actually said for once . show where archie has ever called gays names before , like the f word , or called for violence against gays . if s2 can , i 'll be glad to retract the comment . __namecalling__ and violence are wrong , regardless of where people fall on the issue of gay marriage . in fact , more importantly , they are always wrong no matter what the issue . whatever s2 want to think , __foundit__ . it 's not worth arguing over with a brick wall . __geeez__ __foundit__ . __s1__ suspect personal comments about posters are starting to compete or even outnumber pertinent points about issues s2 are making at this point . __s1__ think __s1__ is going to start using an __acronymn__ whenever s2 do so , that says personal comments & attacks do n't deal with issues . '' __pcaddwi__ '' . that way it will be noted when s2 do it , but it allow s2 to continue dragging down the thread with them . -lrb- or at least you 'll be completely alone in doing so . -rrb- __pcaddwi__ . quote him . quote exactly what he said . cause jason did no such thing ... were __s1__ looking in the mirror when __s1__ said that ? are __s1__ for real ? we have already got archie 's '' __bitchy__ as a gay '' comment . s2 never said he called gays '' __xxxxxx__ '' before . but ai n't it interesting how this board will sensor __######__ or __####__ , but if __s1__ say __xxxxxx__ , it 's __a-ok__ ... the fact that __s1__ argue with me on so many issues , but then throw this arbitrary argument out there , __belittles__ __s1__ 's claim and demonstrates an ulterior motive for ignoring the statement . are __s1__ going to label __s1__ 's own statements as such __jyoshu__ ? cause __s1__ have this boring habit of starting __passive-aggressive__ attacks , belittling other people , and then when somebody calls __s1__ on it or says something about it __s1__ eventually drop it and act surprised when other people point out __s1__ dropped it .
ref_sum ->  this is about the use of arguments of violence towards !!__gay-marriage__!! . __s1__ starts off saying there is a difference between being anti-gay and someone condoning violence against gay people . s2 talks about how violence is used to make people feel threatened to feel a certain way about a topic or debate . s2 used the example of kids being taught about gay marriage in school as a threat . s2 also mentions someone named archie who posts include a variety of slurs towards gay people . __s1__ brushes on the topic , but goes off track from the topic quite a bit . these two people start referring to each others `` attacks '' on each other towards the end . __s1__ says they were referring to !!__namecalling__!! and violence from the original post that was opposing gay rights . these two are n't really in opposite !!__positions/beliefs__!! , but they are more trying to discuss the ways they argue for or against gay marriage and how it may be portrayed by others .
generated -> s1 seriously doubt anyone here does n't agree with s2 . if every religious person who genuinely disagreed with gay marriage because of their religion added a ' but-no-violence !

Article ->  any two adults can run the household , one can make the decision if the other is incapacitated , one inherits when the other dies , etc etc. . that parallel does not carry over to group marriages . when one dies , who inherits ? if one is __incapacitied__ , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two , so __recongnising__ group marriages is a huge legal task , and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious . if we are talking about legal recognition , and we are -lrb- right ? -rrb- , then the cases are wildly different . our marriage laws , for better or worse , are set up on the assumption of two adults running a household . they also assume man and wife , true , but do n't actually depend on that . but the dependence on there being two people is embedded in the laws ; changing that is a huge project . yes , but gays would also want laws changed to __accomodate__ their form of marriage as well . the fact that one requires less change than the other should n't matter , should it ? should having to do more __reworking__ of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality ? it seems to me __s1__ 's argument boils down to '' polygamy requires more work to make the laws __accomodate__ it . '' yeah -- such is the price for marriage equality . let 's face it -- if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for __opposite-sex__ couples which comprise most relationships , they could pull it off -- polygamy , gays , letting 17 year olds marry , etc. . all those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed . means could be set up to determine inheritance , for example . laws can be worded to do it . see , this is why we try to avoid this debate . those who oppose gay marriage inevitably put their own spin on it and drag it to silly conclusion . here we see what gays really want turned into '' make marriage an open-ended institution of equality '' , which then means gay , poly , and 17 year olds in this case . __jyoshu__ stopped there , but it 's not uncommon for it then to go to children , cousins , dogs , whatever . this issue is not '' let 's let everyone do anything they like '' , that 's just the common __reframing__ we see whenever poly relations are brought up while __disscusing__ gay marriage . it happens all the time , it gets old , and that 's why people who have gone through it a bunch of times tend to __aviod__ the whole thing . it happens because there 's no way to avoid logical conclusions . believe it or not , cultural and legal precedent is a very real thing . the events in the article __exemplify__ this . if __s1__ argue to broaden marriage -lrb- which __s1__ are -rrb- , then this is what __s1__ have to deal with . as __s1__ said , s2 did stop with polygamy , gay , and barely lowering the age of consent , so why are you bringing up all the other examples like '' children , cousins dogs , '' or whatever , as if __s1__ were ready to pounce on that ? __s1__ are arguing against degrees that s2 did n't even say , or that no one said . now , do __s1__ have any response to s2 's point that __s1__ 's argument boils down to nothing more than '' polygamy requires more work to make the laws __accomodate__ it '' , or are __s1__ just going to avoid it by getting __sidetracked__ by the fact __s1__ do n't like that we are even talking about this ? again , society can deal with issues like polygamy if they really want to . sure there is . s2 can start with an erroneous assumption , like s2 did , and then arrive at an illogical conclusion , like s2 did . why do n't s2 read the exchanges between me and phyllis ; __s1__ think most of s2 's issues will be addressed that way . do __s1__ feel that opening marriage to gay couples is not a case of broadening marriage ? how is that an erroneous assumption ? sure , but s2 asked __s1__ some specific questions that __s1__ seem to be avoiding . in __s1__ 's exchange with phyllis s2 may comment on matters s2 disagree with . listen to yourself ! we start with '' gays want to get married '' , s2 change it to '' make marriage an open-ended institution of equality '' , and now s2 __segue__ over to '' broadening marriage '' . s2 's erroneous assumption is s2 's statement of what gays are trying to accomplish . until s2 stop trying to change what gays really want into something that s2 can argue against more easily all s2 's arguments will be based on erroneous assumptions . actually , __s1__ did address them . while debating with phyllis . naturally . and naturally __s1__ may ignore them if __s1__ think they are diversions . what gays are trying or not trying -lrb- in terms of intent -rrb- is not the issue . what is the crux here is that marriage would be broadened . it 's not rocket science . __s1__ are moving the boundaries of what constitutes a marriage to include more than __opposite-sex__ couples . very straightforward . s2 know __s1__ do n't like it __phrased__ that way , but that 's what it is . __s1__ ca n't take a phrase like ' gays want to get married '' without looking at the overall implications . in terms of legal rights , s2 do n't see why it would be any different . equality in marriage is equality in marriage regardless of the cultural motivation -- religious , being in love with more than one person , or simply just for the hell of it . for that matter , the argument could be made that __opposite-sex__ marriage between 2 people is largely a religious construct ! i 'll try to explain this to s2 one more time . the stated purpose of gays is quite __relevent__ if s2 are trying to argue against it . gays want to get married . one side effect of that is that some people will see the scope of marriage broadened . gays are not , in and of itself , trying to broaden marriage . they did not wake up one day and say '' let 's try to broaden the scope of marriage today , that 'll be fun ! '' s2 's arguments run along the lines of '' if s2 want to __braoden__ marriage , than s2 must __excpet__ it broadening in all these other ways '' and that 's why s2 's __rephrasing__ does n't work . broadening marriage is n't the goal , it 's a side effect , and since it is n't the goal we do n't have to accept all these other things s2 claim would be the result if they were trying to broaden marriage . to recap , s2 's arguments are based on s2 's assumption that gays want to broaden marriage , that that is their __ulitmate__ goal , the pinnacle of the cause . gays getting married to s2 seems to be the means to that end . that is , of course , backwards , and so s2 's __sematic__ based arguments fail . __kronos__ , s2 just told __s1__ s2 am not dealing here with what gays are trying / not trying to do in terms of intent , yet __s1__ are are arguing as if s2 never even said that . s2 am not arguing what gays have as intent . s2 completely understand what __s1__ are saying . s2 's point here is based on the effect of their intents , whatever that intent is . there is simply no way to get around the fact that if __s1__ change marriage to include other that __opposite-sex__ couples -lrb- to any number of other possibilities -- even one -rrb- , __s1__ are broadening marriage . whether or not gays set out out to do this in terms of a goal is irrelevant . __s1__ are attacking some point about intent that s2 have n't made -- s2 is talking about the effect here . to latch onto some straw man of '' intent '' is to completely miss the point . __s1__ is not ignoring this post , __s1__ is simply choosing not to respond because it 's a pointless distraction in an otherwise __interesing__ thread . if s2 want to start another thread on this theme i 'll explain there how wrong s2 are . well , __s1__ are the one that 's taking issue and making it a distraction !
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : !!__opposers__!! to gay marriage often jump to conclusions about who can get married - why not cousins , group marriages , children , dogs ? polygamous marriage raises legal concerns that are not currently covered in traditional marriage laws , for example . the goal of gay marriage supporters is to be able to get married - not to broaden marriage . broadened marriage is a side effect of legal gay marriage . s2 : gay marriage supporters want marriage laws changed to accommodate gay marriage . broadened marriage could change the current traditional marriage laws . polygamy , for example , would require more marriage laws changed than gay marriage would , as more people are involved . but if enough people wanted legal polygamous marriage , the laws would be passed . marriage would be broadened if gay marriage is made legal , whether that is the goal of gay marriage or not .
generated -> if one is incapacitied , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that parallel does not carry over to group marriages . if one is incapacitied , who decides what the treatment should be ? basically , pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two , so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task , and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious that

Article ->  do n't __s1__ think that in 1909 it was probably viewed mostly from a moral standpoint ? __s1__ do n't think they saw it the same way they would see black people . they did n't even realize that ' homosexuality ' was any sort of innate thing . it was entirely behavioral to them . __s1__ tend to agree with the court , even given what __s1__ have said . __s1__ doubt for 1909 it was about prejudice and bigotry -- they genuinely felt it was wrong . the concept of gay marriage was completely foreign and unknown in 1909 . it was n't even something they conceived of . __s1__ think the court is saying that they could n't have been prejudiced against something they did n't even know of or conceive of . __hogwash__ . it was once entirely moral to believe certain races were inferior , and that women had fewer rights than men . treating the races and women as equal was not something even thought of by many . it was prejudice against gays then , and it still is today . this is not really true . it 's a popular __misconstruing__ of morality and history by proponents of modern ' rights ' movements , but it 's not true . there 's little historical backing to the idea that people believed __oppressing__ black people was a right thing to do , as in , doing good . there were times they used an argument where religion was wrongly used to justify their behavior , but that 's a different matter . if s2 firmly believe otherwise , __s1__ had challenge s2 to show where people thought __oppressing__ blacks was an example if doing good . the same goes for misogyny . furthermore , it 's beside the point anyway . we are talking about homosexuality . in 1909 , the only thing they really understood about the issue at hand was that some people engaged in sexual relations with people of their own gender . there were no articles about '' homosexuality '' as a trait , and certainly none about genetic causes . it was understood entirely from a behavioral standpoint , and therefore a moral standpoint . so it 's not __hogwash__ at all -- they really did view gay sex as immoral . if s2 do n't think so , then s2 have a very poor grasp on history in this case . this kind of morality is based on nothing but ignorance -lrb- which __s1__ admit -rrb- and prejudice . what kind of a basis is that for a so-called moral code ? so what if it involves behaviour ? gay people have sex , develop relationships , and bond , just like everyone else , but in a way that reflects their gay sexuality . this does not mean people could not be prejudiced about the way gay people live . people were , and are so prejudiced . a better reverse analogy would have been to say '' so then __conversly__ __s1__ have the right to advocate that heterosexual relations are morally wrong '' . not __heterosexuality__ , since it 's not homosexuality -lrb- as it 's a state of being -rrb- that religious people have a problem with . heck , they often do n't even recognize it . with that caveat , yes s2 are certainly free to advocate whatever s2 want to be morally wrong . -lrb- and unlike the way some in s2 's movement do , __s1__ wo n't call s2 a '' bigot '' for doing so ! -rrb- it may have been based on '' ignorance '' , but __s1__ reject the notion it was based on prejudice -lrb- and therefore __s1__ tend to agree with the 6 - 0 view of the justices here -rrb- . the 1909 society had too little understanding of gay people to be prejudiced over in the first place . remember , homosexuality was not understood as a state of being at that time . the term itself had not been around long and was not known to most people . and even to those it was known to , it was not known as a state of being . and there certainly was no social identity among gay people as a group -- how could prejudice have existed if there was nothing -lrb- from their perspective -rrb- to be prejudiced toward ? right . provided gays do n't live gay , but live straight , gays can be as gay as they want . as long as gays do n't outwardly show what makes them different from __straights__ , gays can be as gay as they want . it 's bs . also some may not recognize the existence of gay people or their gay lives , but that is putting one 's head in the sand . nonsense . people would widely and __hatefully__ use the term '' __sodomite__ '' to refer to gays . before that the term was '' molly '' . clearly there was an identity they were prejudiced towards . they were rounding up gays in areas they were known to attend , and putting them in prison . read up on the trial of oscar wilde . gays may have been forced underground , to a greater extent , but that does not mean they were not thought of . gays were just not thought of in a nice way . gays were purposely kept out of everything in society , when society did n't really think of gays as human too . that is n't prejudice ? because they did n't approve of sodomy ! do s2 not agree they did n't understand the concept of homosexuality ??? there was no social identity . when they were put on trial , it was n't because they were gay -lrb- which they had no concept of -rrb- , it was because they had gay relations which society viewed as wrong ! no , here 's where s2 do n't get it -- it 's not that '' gays '' -lrb- there was no concept of that -rrb- were purposely kept out of of everything , it 's that people who had sodomy relationships were kept out of everything , because sodomy was viewed as wrong . they really did think it was wrong ! s2 are so determined to portray everything that has anything to do with gay relations possibly being wrong as prejudice and bigotry that s2 are __close-minded__ about it .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : in 1909 , being homosexual was morally wrong , and people could be prejudiced about something that they did not recognize as innate . there was little historical evidence to prove that people in 1909 believed that it was `` right '' or `` good '' to !!__oppress__!! black people or women , and this sentiment extend to homosexuals . in 1909 , people knew that gay sex occurred and they understood its occurrence to be entirely behavioral , and therefore , immoral . homosexuality was not understood as a social identity back then , so there was no `` gay lifestyle '' to be prejudiced against . sodomy was criminalized , not being gay . s2 : there was prejudice against gays in 1909 just as there is now . the !!__immorality__!! of homosexuality in 1909 is based on ignorance . as long as gay people `` lived straight '' , they could be as sexually !!__non-normative__!! as they wanted to be . there were terms for gay men back then , like !!__sodomite__!! and molly , so there was a clear identity for people to be prejudiced against . men who `` acted gay '' were punished for it in 1909 .

Article ->  what about the __domionists__ ? do they care about other people or do they just care about power ? s2 just did a google search and could n't find a __dominionist__ web site at all . the only articles s2 could find on this devious organization are from radical left leaning groups that s2 believe are making this group up as a red herring to create a reason to promote fear of christians . would __s1__ be so kind as to post a link to the __dominionist__ web site that outlines their agenda to take over the country ? just go to jerry __falwell__ or pat robertson and learn what s2 need to know . so what __s1__ are saying is that __s1__ ca n't produce one objective , independent site or source that is by the __dominionists__ themselves as evidence that they are an actual existing group or organization . if __s1__ could , __s1__ would have . this is just one more example of the diabolical agenda of the radical left to make people fear christianity based on more lies and deception . thanks for revealing who the real paranoid __fearmongers__ are . do s2 's own homework , buddy . then stop making assertions __s1__ ca n't back up with evidence . s2 already told __s1__ s2 googled it and found nothing at all by a __dominionist__ organization at all . but __s1__ implied it 's a real group so prove it or else do n't attempt to use it as a method of __demonizing__ christians as a group . the reason why __s1__ __lefties__ must lie and cheat to win is because the truth is __repugnent__ and foreign to you . and __samiinh__ , it 's fascinating that __s1__ posted that article but declined to post the link . how corrupt are __s1__ to with hold the link because it 's from a leftist site that os promoting the lie of the __dominionist__ 's existence without producing any more proof than __s1__ did . s2 could post a link on google right now asserting that all __lefties__ of the socialist , democratic party persuasion are in fact satan worshipers who sacrifice the babies they kidnap from republican christians on an alter to the devil at each full moon . posting it would n't make it true . even though on its surface it 's much more credible than __s1__ 's bogus story about christian __dominionists__ . now post a link with __s1__ 's __slanderous__ article or delete it for the lie that it is .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ suggests that a christian sect known as the __domionists__ are focused only on gaining power , citing jerry __falwell__ and pat robertson as his sources . s2 claims that he was unable to find any evidence of __domionists__ practices online except from left wing groups . he suggests that the !!__dimionists__!! are not a real religious group , but rather are a group invented by left wing groups to make people fear christianity , and further argues that left leaning individuals rely on lying to achieve their goals because they are unfamiliar with the truth . he also presents an absurd story about people on the political left being satan worshipers in order to demonstrate how posting information without evidence to back it up does not make it automatically true .
generated -> the only articles s2 could find on this devious organization are from radical left leaning groups that s2 believe are making this group up as a red herring to create a reason to promote fear of christians . would s1 be so kind as to post a link to the dominionist web site that outlines their agenda to take over the country ?

Article ->  what sex is n't behaviour ? polygamy is not more acceptable by the standards of western society . __s1__ is not sure __s1__ would call it a significant factor of contemporary western society . it is significant in patriarchal societies . no court or government in western society has recognized marriage rights for __polygamists__ . should they ? what are western standards ? what were they 20 yrs ago ? what were they 100 yrs ago ? marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract . it 's not just for a heterosexual contract in the netherlands , belgium , most of canada , and probably not limited that way for much longer in sweden and spain . it wo n't be just for a heterosexual contract in mass. in may . there are married heterosexual couples who either choose to not have children , or can not have children . so it is not just for having a family unit with children either . this is n't europe . there __dirinking__ laws , __prostituition__ laws , and many other laws are different than ours . so are many other countries . if we want to talk about the world the over 90 % of the world does n't recognize homosexuality . mass is taking __stpes__ to ban it . hawaii did the same thing in 1997 and their legislature stopped it . s2 believe mass will do the same . a family is the basic unit in society traditionally consisting of two parents rearing their own or adopted children ; also any of various social units differing from but regarded as equivalent to the traditional family . we are talking about traditional families . a family can be just a wife and husband . it ca n't be two husbands . well , europe or canada is more similar to the u.s. than iran or saudi arabia or namibia . any steps will take years , after the legal marriages have already taken place , if those steps are even successful . single parent families are not generally viewed as traditional . yeah this country is more similar to anglo countries . what 's __s1__ 's point ? what happens in 2050 when they predict __minorites__ will be over 50 % of this country ? hawaii did it in a year . but it is __veiwed__ as natural look at the current __hoity-toity__ polls which show strong support for gay rights among those 18 - 29 . __s1__ do n't see polygamy as a value among minorities in the u.s. hawaii was different , as the legislature made changes against marriage for gays , while the stayed decision was being appealed to the supreme court . so is casual sex and rabies . we do n't judge something as good simply because it is natural . single parenthood is not viewed as the moral traditional ideal among conservatives . they do n't ask them about polygamy . also gays rights is more political than anything else . it does n't really matter does it . we 'll see in the end who 's right . single parent is natural . many husbands die early . that 's natural . __unwed__ mothers is not considered moral but it 's still natural . casual sex is natural but not rational . it will lead to other problems . rabies are viruses . rabies are n't even alive so how can __s1__ call that natural ?
ref_sum ->  s2 claims that marriage is defined as a family unit based on a heterosexual contract . __s1__ refutes this assertion , citing a number of countries which recognize same-sex marriage and compares the lack of reproductive potential for homosexual couples to a heterosexual couple that chooses not to have children or is unable to have children . he also argues that single parent families are not considered traditional and references a poll showing support for gay rights among the 18 - 29 demographic . s2 claims that a traditional family is composed of a husband and wife and that the laws of other countries are irrelevant to the laws of america . he argues that single parent families are natural and suggests that time will decide which side is right .

Article ->  it 's a consideration for many reasons . it 's a tremendous new tax on businesses , the social security system and healthcare systems because this would create a new '' dependent class '' that does n't presently exist . make no mistake about it , gay marriage is about economics . any claims to the contrary are simply false . are __s1__ saying that gay people who pay into the same systems , should n't also benefit ? speaking of dependency , imagine a scenario where a gay person is in a same-sex marriage , that is not legally recognized . this person is also dependent on the other spouse . the marriage breaks up . now , the taxpayer must support the dependent partner , because the marriage was not legally recognized . if it were legal , the richer partner could have been made to support the poorer one , after divorce . same sex marriage marriage partners that are n't legally __mrried__ are called roommates . do we want to start giving benefits to all singles sharing apartments regardless of sexual bent ? that is a separate issue , and could also involve different sex people . we are not talking about singles , or __roomates__ , when we talk of marriage . s2 do n't see __roomates__ sharing an apartment arguing for such a recognition or responsibility . as much as many trust and care for their __roomates__ , it 's not by that much . no , we are not talking about marriage . we are talking about a relationship that some want us to all believe is a marriage . well , if __s1__ want to marry __s1__ 's dog , can i ? of course __s1__ ca n't . it all goes back to the definition of marriage and jack and jack ai n't it . here we go again . if these types of arguments are the best the right wing can come up with and just repeat and repeat ad __nauseum__ , then good luck . in mass. , in ontario , in british columbia , in quebec , in belgium and the netherlands , jack and jack are it . __s1__ is not a right winger . right wingers are way too far left for me . __s1__ is a __jeffersonian__ liberal . __s1__ believe in the constitution as written . they are only allowed in mass. because the '' people 's will '' has n't been heard yet . the majority of americans are against same sex marriage , no matter how s2 try to spin it , so __s1__ is guessing that the laws will be solidified so that any ambiguity is removed very soon . as for canada and the netherlands , __s1__ could care less . __s1__ do n't live or pay a dime in taxes to support either . are __s1__ speaking of the federal marriage __ammendment__ to the u.s. constitution ? everything s2 have heard indicates it 's a long shot . at any rate , it is just a guess what will or wo n't happen a few years in the future . s2 was just pointing out what was happening internationally -lrb- mass. is international for me , a canadian -rrb- .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that the issue of same-sex marriage is an economic issue because it would have negative effects on businesses , social security , and the healthcare systems . he compares homosexual partners to roommates and and demonstrates that you can not make marriage mean whatever you want by explaining that he is not legally allowed to marry his dog . he makes it clear that he believes same-sex marriage is wrong and claims that the majority of americans are also against same-sex marriage . s2 suggests that homosexual partners would not be a burden on the mentioned systems because they would be paying into the systems as well as receiving benefits from them . he cites the legalization of same-sex marriages in various other countries in europe and north america .
generated -> tremendous new tax on businesses , the social security system and healthcare systems because this would create a new '' dependent class '' that does n't presently exist . make no mistake about it , gay people who pay into the same systems , should n't also benefit ? speaking of dependency , imagine a scenario where a gay person is in a same-sex marriage , that is not legally recognized that

Article ->  they did leave in a very key statement in the provision essentially making it __non-mandatory__ to some extent '' but it also says marriage officers need not perform a ceremony between same-sex couples if doing so would conflict with his or her '' conscience , religion and belief . '' -lrb- at least they have recognized that making officials do that may be infringing on their religious freedom . the link does n't work . this is unfortunate if it applies to public officials . s2 believe public officials are there to serve all members of the public , equally under the law . that 's their job . s2 is glad they have to do their job in canada . would __http__ want a public servant to refuse __http__ because he or she does not share __http__ 's evangelical beliefs , __jyoshu__ ? __s1__ certainly would not want someone forced to do something against their religious beliefs . if __s1__ went to a public official and it were against their religious belief to perform a heterosexual civil ceremony , __s1__ had simply find someone that would , rather than try to force that person to do it . here 's the corrected link , by the way if one ca n't do the job , one should look for another job . apparently not , in south africa . __s1__ do n't see why marriage freedom should automatically trump religious freedom , and apparently sa feels the same way . do __s1__ agree with me then , that this is an impediment to the public servant doing his or her job ? this is nonsense . s2 is glad s2 live in canada , where the religion of others is not imposed into s2 's life .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ cites a key statement in the same-sex marriage legislation that allows marriage officers the right not to perform a same-sex marriage if it conflicts with their conscience , religion , or beliefs . he believes this is a good caveat , claiming that forcing officials to perform same-sex marriages would be infringing upon their religious freedom . he argues that if a public official had a religious objection to heterosexual marriages , then he would not expect that person to perform his marriage and would instead seek out someone who would . s2 believes it is inappropriate for public officials to be able to deny services based on their personal religious beliefs . if they are unable to do their job , he suggests , they should not be able to hold that position .

ref_sum ->  __s1__ challenges s2 to debate the cause of the spread of aids in the united states and encourages s2 to attempt to challenge his claims with proof that they are untrue . he accuses s2 of attempting to change the debate and making personal attacks rather than addressing the question at hand . he suggests that if the debate occurs , he will prove his assertions true . s2 claims that the origin of aids in the united states is unknown and that the spread of aids was caused by unclean needles , unprotected sex , and contaminated blood transfusions . he rejects the requirement that he should provide proof for his claims by citing __s1__ 's failure to do so . he suggests that once __s1__ begins to debate appropriately , then he will too .

Article ->  we all know the possibility exists . __s1__ simply have n't seen anyone present any even half way convincing argument that any of those possibilities are , in fact , a reality . all __s1__ are saying is '' they say it 's morals '' which is no argument at all . calling a tail a leg , etc. . furthermore , why do __s1__ start with the premise that it 's prejudice , rather than needing proof of that -lrb- instead expecting proof of a negative -- that it 's not -rrb- ? __s1__ did n't start with that premise , it 's simply the most likely answer . __s1__ know of no moral system that condones hurting others when said harm is n't preventing some other harm , so morals are out . religion is a good reason for choosing s2 's own actions but it 's no reason for telling others how to live , so that 's out . prejudice against gays has been around for ages , so that 's quite likely . and no other explanations come to mind . straight forward . __s1__ is sure __s1__ have explained this to s2 before , and have invited s2 to come up with alternate explanations . __s1__ do so again . __s1__ is particularly interested to see s2 's response now that s2 seem to have gotten over the idea that simply calling something moral or religious does not mean that it ca n't be prejudice at the same time . and neither does christianity . it too is a moral system . that 's why when people claim religion in their acts of prejudice , they are actually abandoning that moral system , rather than engaging in it . so yes , morals are out -- s2 is glad __s1__ are seeing that now . so s2 finally see that people can claim a moral or religious stance while not actually having one ? excellent ! glad to hear it . now , care to address the matter at hand ? can s2 show me , preferably in reality as opposed to a hypothetical , how one could justify pushing an anti-gay agenda based on actual morals or religion ? because __s1__ have never seen it myself . nice attempt at trying to refute a point that has n't even been made here . the matter at hand is that prejudice may in fact not be what 's behind people 's opposition to gays being in romantic relationships . in some cases -lrb- well , s2 had say many cases -rrb- it 's religious belief , which may be separate from prejudice . the people s2 have been around who __fel__ that way were doing it because of their religious beliefs . in fact , it 's my reason as well . actually it was __s1__ 's point . s2 have refused to acknowledge this so many times in the past that __s1__ could n't even count . __s1__ is glad s2 are past it now . fine , than if it 's s2 's reasoning than spell it out for me . do n't worry about anyone else 's reasoning , just give me yours . take me , step by step , from '' this is __s1__ 's religious belief '' to '' therefore other people should n't be gay -lrb- or act gay or whatever -rrb- '' . leave nothing out , spell out s2 's assumptions , give me the whole ball of wax . because in all __s1__ 's years __s1__ have never once seen anyone come close to doing so without resorting to prejudice . for bonus points extend it all the way to '' and so public policy __disadvantageous__ to gays should be enacted '' . s2 have never said that people ca n't claim to have a moral belief and not really have one . people can conceivably lie about anything -- we ca n't base our discussion on the worry that people might be lying about their stance ; that could be the case in any situation about any issue . no , it 's a religious belief . there 's no more '' reasoning '' to it than believing in faith that christ is a __ressurected__ being . s2 believe it because it 's biblical -- it 's what the bible says . that 's why s2 believe people should n't do it . it 's not so complicated , really . no one is saying you have to believe that way . but it is the way s2 believe , and that 's s2 's business . if s2 imposed s2 's beliefs , that would be one thing , but s2 do n't . s2 do n't impose anything on __s1__ or anyone else , nor do s2 want to . get it ? and yet __s1__ ca n't see how s2 made that jump . s2 believe , fine . but why should n't other people do it ? what do s2 's beliefs have to do with other people 's actions ? so s2 do n't impose ? s2 do n't take any action which could have an obvious negative impact on another person based solely on s2 's religious beliefs ? if that 's true than __s1__ have no problem with you , and s2 are not one of the people __s1__ is talking about here . __s1__ did specify people pushing an anti-gay agenda after all . are s2 saying that the people in '' focus on the family '' , or whatever they are called , are in fact doing wrong then ? since they are clearly trying to impose their views on others , which s2 and __s1__ seem to agree is wrong .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : religion is a good tool to guide one 's own actions , but not for telling others how to live . people have been prejudiced against homosexuals for a long time . moral or religious prejudice is still prejudice . a person can claim a moral or religious stance without having one . you can not justify an anti-gay agenda on morals or religion . an anti-gay stance on the grounds of religious belief is prejudice . prejudice based on religious belief implies that a religious person 's acts of prejudice could have a negative impact on homosexuals , because they believe that being gay is morally reprehensible . s2 : prejudice is a fact of human existence . christianity is a moral system . when people claim religion in morals , they abandon that moral system . it is religious belief - not prejudice - that makes one take an anti-gay stance . the bible says that homosexuality is wrong , so if you believe in the bible as your moral canon , then you believe that homosexuality is wrong as well .

Article ->  new england and new york will probably have gay marriage within the next few years . the west coast might also follow suit after that . __s1__ think the recent wave of gay marriage legalization will stop for the next 20 years or so after that . 30 states already define marriage as between a man and a woman . do n't be so sure . if congress removes doma and with roberts and alito on the court same sex marriage will come to the rest of the country with a 7 to 2 ruling . roberts and alito are constitutional __literalists__ and with doma out of the way the full faith and credit clause is a clear constitutional mandate . can s2 demonstrate evidence that the __scotus__ would nullify gay marriage bans in all states ? if the __scotus__ was so imposed , why do n't they just strike doma down right now and then declare all gay marriage bans unconstitutional ? secondly , states can choose not to recognize gay marriage even without federal doma . there is a choice of law doctrine that allows states to not recognize other states marriages that they find '' offensive '' to their own public policy . states have been not recognizing each others marriages for decades and states do not use the __ffc__ clause to make one state recognize another 's marriage . there is no case history of __ffc__ ever used in this way . even in cases where it has been attempted , the legal argument involved is so lengthy , that it effectively prohibits __ffc__ use due to the sheer amount of hassle and legal proceedings involved in winning such a case . it is called the constitution of the united states a marriage license is a public act and record which __http__ are obviously ignorant of . __http__ completely failed to respond to the choice of law doctrine , as well as __s1__ 's request that __http__ provide justification on __http__ 's claims of how each justice would vote , as well as __s1__ 's challenge to __http__ to explain why doma has not been declared unconstitutional if __http__ 's claims about the justices were true . apparently , the law is beyond __http__ 's comprehension , as is __http__ 's ability to consider facts in forming __http__ 's opinions . in answer to __s1__ 's question . steven , kennedy , souter , ginsburg , and breyer will side with us . roberts and alito will follow the constitution as written . scalia and thomas are a lost anti gay cause . that is how s2 know how they will vote . as to why doma has not been declared unconstitutional is because there has not been a case in the courts challenging doma and so has not been taken up by __scotus__ . i 'll do a little research on s2 's claims . regardless , s2 still failed to address how state courts may use the choice of law doctrine so that the __ffc__ clause does not apply , and if it were , the sheer complication of applying the law would make it effectively prohibitive . by all means , post up the __ffc__ clause again so s2 can avoid addressing this . s2 do not see how choice of law doctrine is not trumped by the full faith and credit clause in cases of marriage contract since there is a current tradition of one state respecting other states marriage licenses when it comes to __heteros__ . the choice of law doctrine is used to settle differences between different state laws . that is how the law is practiced , and that is what courts believe . again , states have been disagreeing on the validity of each other 's marriages for decades and there has been no case history of the full faith and credit clause that has made one state recognize another state 's marriage . courts look to the choice of law doctrine before the __ff__ & c c.
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : legally , it is complicated to legalize gay marriage in all states , as doma is in place and states have chosen not to recognize other state 's marriages for decades . attempts abide by the __ffc__ clause to in respect to marriage -lrb- even before doma -rrb- require such lengthy legal arguments that they are rendered prohibitive . the choice of law doctrine must be considered and doma could be found to be unconstitutional by vote of the __scotus__ . how will states use the choice of law doctrine so that the __ffc__ clause does not apply ? s2 : if congress removes doma , a vote for legal gay marriage will pass quickly , and certain justices of __scotus__ already approve of gay marriage . doma has yet to be declared unconstitutional because there has yet to be a case made to challenge doma in the courts , so it has not been decided upon by __scotus__ . the choice of law doctrine trumps the __ffc__ clause in cases of marriage contract and there is a current tradition of respecting other states marriage licenses for .
generated -> s1 think the recent wave of gay marriage legalization will stop for the next 20 years . if congress removes doma and with roberts and alito on the court same sex marriage will come to the rest of the country with a 7 to 2 ruling . if congress removes doma and with roberts and alito on the court same sex marriage will come to the rest of the country with a 7 to 2 ruling .

Article ->  withers dc council votes for gay marriage by james withers , contributing editor , 365 gay blog __12.15.2009__ pm est in a 11 - 2 vote , the city council of washington , dc voted for gay marriage . we are a bit __short-handed__ today , so expect more about this later . until then have a sip of the bubbly and congrats to the district . wait until it 's put on a ballot for the voters to decide . this is n't the first time that a liberal government did n't pay attention to the will of the people . and what is the will of the people jp ? people in support of marriage equality is steadily growing . compare the polls from ten years ago to now to see ... it is only a matter of time before equality stands upon the side of the majority . s2 keep hearing gays say that but every time it 's put to a vote , __s1__ lose . s2 had say that it 's time to try another tact because the current one is a losing proposition . the only thing forcing gay marriage on a population does is galvanize them against the forced action . and when they respond on the ballot , they do so __punatively__ . just wait until __s1__ see the repercussions of the current efforts to give all federal employee 's same sex partners __bennies__ on our dime despite doma . s2 is guessing that some additional democratic heads will roll in the fall election if that flies . __s1__ need a pr strategy that highlights the advantages of gay unions over __bathhouse__ and gay bar __existences__ . s2 believe that a true majority of people would support civil unions but not marriage . and s2 count myself amongst that majority . actually jp so far 5 states have passed gay marriage so no not every time it is put to a vote do we lose . and how am __s1__ forcing anyone to accept gay marriage ? am __s1__ forcing these voters to attend __s1__ 's wedding or dare __s1__ say be in a marriage themselves ? and __s1__ can not agree with s2 more about changing the image of the gay community as a whole . . we are not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people running around ... what __s1__ find funny is once strait people find out how boring we really are , and how we pay taxes just like every other joe __schmo__ they 'll think nothing more of special rights lol ... but actually like __s1__ stated earlier in another thread if those unions constituted the same legal rights as married couples __s1__ would be content . which 5 states put gay marriage on the ballot and it won ? to the best of s2 's knowledge , no state that has gay marriage today has ever gotten it via the ballot . it has either been the court or legislature that has forced it on the state . the gays s2 know are as boring as mr and mrs john q. public as well , but that 's not the image that is portrayed to the general public . like s2 said , __s1__ have a pr problem . s2 think that if more gays were willing to settle for civil unions that were more equivalent to marriage , __s1__ had have an easier time gaining legal acceptance . ok maybe not the ballot ... got me there man . lol ... . maine was a close one though . and yeah we got a major pr problem big time ... and __s1__ said as long as we got the legal rights of marriage and called it __cu__ __s1__ would be cool with that . __s1__ already wear a dress and heels enough as it is ! __lmao__ jk ... . s2 hope that you , at least , shave __s1__ 's legs . __;-rrb-__ oh __s1__ do ... __lmao__ __naw__ __s1__ do n't wear a dress __s1__ would n't look good in one ...
ref_sum ->  __s1__ : washington dc ' s city council recently legalized gay marriage . people 's support of gay marriage has been growing steadily in the past ten years , and will soon be the majority opinion . five states have already legalized gay marriage . those opposed to gay marriage may view gays as promiscuous and sexual !!__deviants__!! , but most gay men are !!__assuredly__!! quite normal . civil unions will not be accepted in place of marriage , as they do not allow the same legal rights as marriage . s2 : councils and legislatures may vote in favor of gay marriage , but it has yet to be the majority vote of the people . gay marriage should be played in a positive light by its supporters , because the current public perception of gay men is that they are promiscuous and lead a `` gay lifestyle '' that is offensive . anti-gay marriage supporters will support civil unions in lieu of gay marriage , and homosexuals should be satisfied with that .

Article ->  well ... so far eight out of nine state supreme courts that have taken up the issue have found that barring same-sex marriage is unconstitutional . we are waiting to hear about three or four more . as for the nature of marriage , it is both a legal contract and -lrb- sometimes -rrb- a religious ceremony -lrb- sacrament in some religions -rrb- . we are stuck with the __duality__ , whether we like it or not , and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect . different religions can do what they want . they found that it violated their state __constitutions__ , right ? this has nothing to do with the us constitution . the winning arguments were based largely on state constitutional provisions that closely parallel , if not outright __mimmick__ , the federal constitution . that 's not generally true , is it ? for example , the massachusetts ruling was based on a specific provision in the mass. constitution that prohibits discrimination based on sexual preference . there 's nothing like that in the us constitution . and s2 's overall point was that we should be careful when calling something '' unconstitutional '' , in that we should be clear it we are talking state or federal constitution . many state __constitutions__ guarantee rights that are n't in the __fedral__ constitution . there 's nothing like that in the mass. . constitution either . though , it 's a __darned__ good idea ! goodrich was decided on equal protection grounds , citing the mass. document . __s1__ had have to look up the others to see the exact reasoning , but they are not likely to be far afield from the bedrock principles of equal protection and due process . gay rights is a real test of our constitutional system , and , so far , we are not passing with flying colors ... __s1__ are right , s2 __misremembered__ . it 's just __descrimination__ based on sex that 's banned .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing the issue of marriage equality . both subjects seem to be on the fence with the issue . __s1__ cites that eight of nine supreme courts have contended same sex marriage to be unconstitutional . s2 questions how gay marriage would violate someone 's constitutional rights . __s1__ advises the bulk of the arguments were based on state __constitutions__ which mirror the federal constitution . s2 uses the example of massachusetts ' allowing gay marriage under its state constitutional law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation . __s1__ contends there is no such piece to the massachusetts constitution . s2 then concedes he was incorrect about the citing and the law actually banned only discrimination based on gender and not sexual orientation .
generated -> marriage , it is both a legal contract and -lrb- sometimes -rrb- a religious ceremony -lrb- sacrament in some religions -rrb- , whether we like it or not , and the courts can and must deal with the legal aspect . the winning arguments were based on state constitutional provisions that closely parallel , if not outright mimmick , the federal constitution .

Article ->  it would lead ultimately down the road to a marriage bill for __polygamists__ . that is why the current push for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage also contains a provision banning polygamous marriage as well . hmm ... . some opposition to the petition ... more left wing ideology at work . if the man after god s own heart had multiple wives , why can t i ? have heard others say that we already have polygamy in america . it s called serial polygamy because of our liberal divorce laws . so now those that are opposed to even more laws on the books and a return to old testament practices are considered left wing ? what s this world coming too ? lol king david having multiple wives was under old testament practice . jesus himself stated that divorce laws were granted by moses and allowed by god because of the __hardness__ of the people hearts . jesus said a man shall leave his father and mother and be __cleaved__ to his wife , not wives . __btw__ , its called serial __monogamy__ . if its ' right wing ' to support a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage than its ' left wing ' to oppose a ban on homosexual / polygamous marriage . so is it a sin or just a practice ? s2 don t remember jesus saying polygamy was wrong . the statement __s1__ referred to does indicate that he was talking about a single wife , but s2 __wouldn__ t base a whole social convention on one word out of a whole book . anyway the jews don t believe in the new testament . would it be okay for them ? man s2 screwed that one up . s2 ll try to be a little more articulate in the future . okay was just wondering . base 's wing on what think is correct , not left or right . a few years ago it was right wing to be against the deficit , now it seems to be left wing . but that just shows what know about wings . lol the idea that it is now left wing to be against deficits is absurd . numerous democrats actually wanted to spend more than the bush administrations 12.5 % increase in federal spending . s2 was basing that on __s1__ 's previous statement in other words , anything that is opposed to one wing must be the opposite so s2 don t see how it s absurd unless __s1__ want to call __s1__ 's original statement absurd . this is obviously not the thread for this discussion but s2 will reply this time and see where it takes us . __s1__ __didn__ t state what __s1__ considered to be numerous nor did __s1__ supply anything to back up that statement . however deficits depend on both increased spending and lower revenues . bush has done both with large tax cuts and large discretionary spending increases . and even the conservatives are beginning to criticize him for being a big spending president . over the past 23 years , conservative administrations have increased the deficits and liberal administrations have decreased the deficits . so yeah it looks to me like left wing is against deficits and right wing is for deficits .
ref_sum ->  two people are debating the topic of gay marriage rights . __s1__ believes allowing gays to marry will open up the door to legalize other types of marriage such as polygamy . s2 holds to the theory that if king david was able to have multiple wives , why then should the common man not be able to , especially if religion is to now be the basis for all laws . __s1__ contends that practice was of the old testament and is no longer considered commonplace . s2 feels __s1__ is too left wing to entertain the thought of allowing gay marriage , but uses religion as the basis even though there are so many contradictions between the old testament and what is considered the new testament .
generated -> some opposition to the petition ... more left wing ideology at work . if the man after god s own heart had multiple wives , why can t i ? have heard others say that we already have polygamy in america that

Article ->  __s1__ think a better comparison is __sodom__ ... . these are the comments that make __s1__ a homophobic bigot , not __s1__ 's opposition to gay marriage . in s2 's mind yes ... . when s2 have bath houses in sf that have 100 men in a daisy chain performing unprotected sex on one another __s1__ would make the comparison to __sodom__ ... . that is not homophobic , that is a fact and s2 should condemn it too ... . so , __s1__ have been there to see this s2 take it or are __s1__ going on rumors and misinformation . did __s1__ read about this on the focus on family website ? sorry , s2 just do n't believe you . go to yahoo and do a search on san francisco gay bath houses if s2 do n't believe me ... . when the aids first came out they were shut down but they are flourishing again now and the occupants have gone back to unprotected sex ... . from what __s1__ have surmised s2 are gay . __s1__ am surprised s2 did not know that ... . you made a very specific claim about 100 men in a daisy chain having unprotected sex . it is clear to me that post was not based in fact , but opinion . if __s1__ do n't have the proof of the claim , __s1__ should n't make it ! that is what makes __s1__ a __homophobe__ . __s1__ make claims about gays without knowing the truth . why do s2 think they closed the bath houses down in the eighties ? this , at last check is 2005 , what they did in the 80 's has nothing to do with the topic at hand , or __s1__ 's comments . so either justify __s1__ 's comments or take them back and admit they were __uncalled__ for ... joe s2 need to read the link __s1__ cited in a post in this thread ... . gays in sf are trying to get the bath houses reopened ... . great ! what does that have to do with gay rights ? what does it have to do with the title of this thread ? how can __s1__ take what a small group of gays in california are doing and equate it to the behaviors of all gays . that is irresponsible .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ is against gay rights apparently because of the biblical story of __sodom__ , and the sexual activities __s1__ perceives to have occurred in san francisco bath houses , which __s1__ asserts the current gay community is trying to re-open . he argues that the gay community is going back to unprotected sex and that a daisy chain of 100 men perform unprotected sex on each other in the bath houses . s2 challenges the assumptions , specifically finding the daisy chain of 100 men a less than credible assertion and !!__admonishes__!! __s1__ to use facts to support his arguments , not opinions . s2 also notes that __s1__ 's apparent fascination with bath houses is not relevant to the gay rights topic under which the posts are being entered .

ref_sum ->  prior to this dialog , s2 apparently likened the gay marriage movement to the civil rights movement of the african american community . __s1__ is offended by the alleged analogy , finding a material distinction between race and sexual orientation . she suggests that to view it otherwise would be an insult to all african americans . s2 points out that two presumably prominent african american figures , !!__corretta__!! scott king and __jullian__ bond , are !!__pro-gay__!! marriage . __s1__ questions whether they do in fact support gay marriage , and s2 provides links to support his assertion . __s1__ accepts the evidence and concedes that some african americans may not be as insulted by the analogy and wonders how martin luther king felt about the issue of gay marriage .

Article ->  agreed , when the husband is part of a __hetero__ relationship . gay husband is not a legally recognized category . agreed , when the wife is part of a __hetero__ relationship . gay wife is not a legally recognized category . agreed , when the spouse is part of a __hetero__ relationship . gay spouse is not a legally recognized category . so the fact that it is not legally recognized is the problem . what is the reason it 's not legally recognized ? because the couple is gay . where do __s1__ get the figure of 500,000 gay couples who want to immediately be married ? would these gay couples beat the straight couples in some kind of a race to the weddings occurring at the same time , or occurring over the course of a month or a year ? they are not legally recognized because they do n't meet the legal criteria for marriage , ie one man , one woman . a cat does n't meet the legal definition of a dog . do we change the definition of dog to appease the cat ? that 's the real question to be answered by society . actually , __s1__ pulled the number out of the air for __illustrative__ purposes only , but after reading the cbo report , __s1__ see that __s1__ was n't far off . they predicted 600,000 gay couples would want to get married it allowed . this is circular reasoning however . it 's stating that marriage simply is heterosexual , and so completely ends debate . exactly __s1__ 's point , just as a cat can never be considered a dog just because someone wants it to be . to me , and __s1__ is guessing millions of others , the term gay marriage is an __oxymoron__ . that 's not to say that we should n't consider the possibility of allowing gay unions with , possibly , equivalent rights to __hetero__ couples if we , as a society , see the benefit in doing so . for example , prior to fdr , the concept of state welfare was considered ludicrous and unconstitutional , but he was able to get enough support -lrb- and enough political muscle -rrb- to change society 's mind on the role of the federal gov ' t once he demonstrated the '' good '' that doing so had on america in its most dire time of need . people were willing to sacrifice a little freedom for security just as ben franklin had warned against . now , i 'll be the first to tell s2 that __s1__ think fdr was the biggest threat to american freedom that ever existed , but one ca n't argue his ability to change public opinion on the role of the federal gov ` t . it concerns reason , as __jaxian__ said earlier . what are the logical reasons for marriage discrimination against gays and lesbians ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ does not believe that anyone outside of a heterosexual marriage should be considered a husband , wife or a spouse because legally they are not . this person believes that the term gay marriage is an __oxymoron__ because marriage , legally , to them , is only between one man and one woman . they believe that prior to roosevelt , society did not accept the idea of state welfare as constitutional , but because people were willing to sacrifice freedom for security , they eventually caved to his ideas . s2 does not believe that marriage is simply between one man and one woman , and that the entire reason behind the debate is so that homosexual marriage can and will be legally recognized . they do not see a reason for discrimination against homosexual marriage .
generated -> s1 pulled the number out of the air for illustrative purposes only , but after reading the cbo report , s1 see that s1 was n't far off . it 's stating that marriage simply is heterosexual , and so completely ends debate that

Article ->  __s1__ 's __apologizies__ . __s1__ read it hastily and got it completely __bassackwards__ . the cbo estimate in 's link did , indeed , say that the result would be up to ~ $ 1 billion surplus . so __s1__ also recognize that __s1__ 's argument that same-sex marriage does not benefit society is also '' __bassackwards__ '' ? finally ! some progress . remember ... this thread is supposed to be about fiscal concerns . __s1__ have conceded that it does n't have the negative financial impact that __s1__ thought it would . that was the purpose for __s1__ 's attempting to have a civil debate on what __s1__ thought the issues were . __s1__ had like to move past the fiscal concerns and onto the moral and health concerns if we can continue to do s2 with civility . gosh , s2 love a good typo ! in any case , s2 suppose a tepid concession is all we can expect . good catch . and s2 were hoping for ... ? a forthright concession . any maybe some discussion of how same-sex marriage benefits society in practical ways . instead , we are off to __s1__ 's safe ground of '' morality '' . safe , not because __s1__ are right , but because morality is relative and is subjective . __s1__ was hoping that s2 had be telling me the benefits , not vice versa . but s2 forget , __s1__ is not one of '' those '' who feels the need to impose __s1__ 's morality on everyone else . __s1__ is more than willing to let society as a whole determine its own limits . while __s1__ is a staunch defender of the constitution -lrb- as written , not as interpreted -rrb- , __s1__ is way more flexible with public determined acceptable standards of behavior . i 'll even cut __s1__ 's grass so that it is the same level as __s1__ 's neighbors .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ concedes that there would be little financial impact on support for homosexual marriage , and would in fact supply a surplus . however , this person still desires a debate on moral and health concerns of the issue . they do not view themselves as someone who imposes their moral beliefs on others , and is willing to let society determine its own limits . while they vocally defend the united states constitution as written , they also desire to be more flexible with public determined acceptance of behavior . s2 would like to see this concession as a means to lead to a discussion on the societal benefits of same-sex marriage , however , they believe that __s1__ is attempting to hide behind their moral grounds because __s1__ sees it as relative and subjective .

Article ->  should they ? what are western standards ? what were they 20 yrs ago ? what were they 100 yrs ago ? marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract . where would that put families started by artificial insemination ? the same as any other heterosexual couple . it 's not the way children are created -lrb- adopted , __serrogacy__ , etc -rrb- . it ' s the nature of the relationship -lrb- heterosexual -rrb- . natural refers to nature not child bearing . which god enforces marriage rules when the __cermony__ is __performend__ by a judge ? there was a tribe in the congo that allowed it . their __shamans__ told them that the warriors could only marry outer warriors . to be with a women , they thought , might make then softer , and more woman like , and not as fearless in combat . ok , so conceiving a child is not what makes it nature , what is it ? __wouldn__ t polygamy also include some of that same sex taboo , to women marred together ? why do __s1__ feel __s1__ 's values are right and others that disagree as wrong ? polygamy is not women married together . it 's one man or women married to multiple of the opposite sex like a harem or entourage . everyone feels their values are right or else they would n't believe in them . what we value shows . of course atheist do n't believe in god so they have a different set of values . __s1__ of course believe in god first , family second , and country third . if s2 have different values then of course s2 will think yours are better if not then s2 would n't have them . our values are what guide us . __s1__ feel that from perspective __s1__ 's values give someone a better balance and stability to function in society . s2 probably think otherwise but __s1__ feel statistically __s1__ can support mine . sorry , s2 don t practice polygamy ; s2 don t know the inner workings of the family . s2 would think it would be a good way for __bi-sexual__ to stay below the radar . s2 worded the question badly ; s2 should have asked why do __s1__ feel that __s1__ 's morals should be forced on to others ? by keeping the laws the way they are now it is discrimination . correct me if s2 am wrong , but s2 did not think __s1__ could fire some one for being gay . it 's all good __s1__ did n't think s2 knew what s2 were talking about __anyways__ ? the questions is why should they force their moral on us ? should we let other people like nudist and rapist force their __mroals__ on us ? how is allowing them to marry forcing there morals on us ? yes we would have to deal with the fact of it , but the us has been dealing with the fact of polygamy fro years . there is only one case that was prosecuted in recent history -lrb- that was mostly due to one of his wives being 14 when married . when society __legalizes__ behavior it is in fact accepting it as __non-detrimental__ and accepting it . it is a form of forcing our society to accept the behavior .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ makes the claim that marriage is defined as a family unit based on natural heterosexual contact , and suggests that it is the heterosexual nature of the relationship that is important , not how the children are conceived within the relationship . he argues that homosexuals are attempting to force their morals on others by legalizing same-sex marriage , claiming that legalizing a behavior is a tacit form of acceptance that will affect society . s2 questions the religious basis of a civil ceremony like marriage , suggesting that the !!__stipulations__!! based on religious reasons would vary depending on the chosen religion . he also compares homosexuality to polygamy , claiming that polygamy has been unofficially accepted for years , and argues that maintaining the current same-sex marriage bans should be considered discriminatory .

ref_sum ->  s2 suggests that he would be liberal if modern liberalism was actually __jeffersonian__ , meaning that democracy is viewed as the power of the people . he cites jefferson 's beliefs that war can be necessary in order to maintain liberty and that centralized government is a threat , and points out how these beliefs are the opposite of modern liberalism . he further claims that the current democratic party is __anti-religion__ , __over-regulatory__ , and controlled by the gay lobby . __s1__ !!__interprets__!! s2 's argument as a claim that fairness should exist for all people except homosexuals . s2 !!__clarifies__!! that he does support equal opportunity for all people regardless of their sexual behavior , but that he is still opposed to redefining the traditional view of marriage by legalizing same-sex marriage for homosexuals .

Article ->  what about the __domionists__ ? do they care about other people or do they just care about power ? s2 just did a google search and could n't find a __dominionist__ web site at all . the only articles s2 could find on this devious organization are from radical left leaning groups that s2 believe are making this group up as a red herring to create a reason to promote fear of christians . would __s1__ be so kind as to post a link to the __dominionist__ web site that outlines their agenda to take over the country ? just go to jerry __falwell__ or pat robertson and learn what s2 need to know . so what __s1__ are saying is that __s1__ ca n't produce one objective , independent site or source that is by the __dominionists__ themselves as evidence that they are an actual existing group or organization . if __s1__ could , __s1__ would have . this is just one more example of the diabolical agenda of the radical left to make people fear christianity based on more lies and deception . thanks for revealing who the real paranoid __fearmongers__ are . do s2 's own homework , buddy . then stop making assertions __s1__ ca n't back up with evidence . s2 already told __s1__ s2 googled it and found nothing at all by a __dominionist__ organization at all . but __s1__ implied it 's a real group so prove it or else do n't attempt to use it as a method of __demonizing__ christians as a group . the reason why __s1__ __lefties__ must lie and cheat to win is because the truth is __repugnent__ and foreign to you . and __samiinh__ , it 's fascinating that __s1__ posted that article but declined to post the link . how corrupt are __s1__ to with hold the link because it 's from a leftist site that os promoting the lie of the __dominionist__ 's existence without producing any more proof than __s1__ did . s2 could post a link on google right now asserting that all __lefties__ of the socialist , democratic party persuasion are in fact satan worshipers who sacrifice the babies they kidnap from republican christians on an alter to the devil at each full moon . posting it would n't make it true . even though on its surface it 's much more credible than __s1__ 's bogus story about christian __dominionists__ . now post a link with __s1__ 's __slanderous__ article or delete it for the lie that it is .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ suggests that a christian sect known as the __domionists__ are focused only on gaining power , citing jerry __falwell__ and pat robertson as his sources . s2 claims that he was unable to find any evidence of __domionists__ practices online except from left wing groups . he suggests that the !!__dimionists__!! are not a real religious group , but rather are a group invented by left wing groups to make people fear christianity , and further argues that left leaning individuals rely on lying to achieve their goals because they are unfamiliar with the truth . he also presents an absurd story about people on the political left being satan worshipers in order to demonstrate how posting information without evidence to back it up does not make it automatically true .
generated -> the only articles s2 could find on this devious organization are from radical left leaning groups that s2 believe are making this group up as a red herring to create a reason to promote fear of christians . would s1 be so kind as to post a link to the dominionist web site that outlines their agenda to take over the country ?

Article ->  what sex is n't behaviour ? polygamy is not more acceptable by the standards of western society . __s1__ is not sure __s1__ would call it a significant factor of contemporary western society . it is significant in patriarchal societies . no court or government in western society has recognized marriage rights for __polygamists__ . should they ? what are western standards ? what were they 20 yrs ago ? what were they 100 yrs ago ? marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract . it 's not just for a heterosexual contract in the netherlands , belgium , most of canada , and probably not limited that way for much longer in sweden and spain . it wo n't be just for a heterosexual contract in mass. in may . there are married heterosexual couples who either choose to not have children , or can not have children . so it is not just for having a family unit with children either . this is n't europe . there __dirinking__ laws , __prostituition__ laws , and many other laws are different than ours . so are many other countries . if we want to talk about the world the over 90 % of the world does n't recognize homosexuality . mass is taking __stpes__ to ban it . hawaii did the same thing in 1997 and their legislature stopped it . s2 believe mass will do the same . a family is the basic unit in society traditionally consisting of two parents rearing their own or adopted children ; also any of various social units differing from but regarded as equivalent to the traditional family . we are talking about traditional families . a family can be just a wife and husband . it ca n't be two husbands . well , europe or canada is more similar to the u.s. than iran or saudi arabia or namibia . any steps will take years , after the legal marriages have already taken place , if those steps are even successful . single parent families are not generally viewed as traditional . yeah this country is more similar to anglo countries . what 's __s1__ 's point ? what happens in 2050 when they predict __minorites__ will be over 50 % of this country ? hawaii did it in a year . but it is __veiwed__ as natural look at the current __hoity-toity__ polls which show strong support for gay rights among those 18 - 29 . __s1__ do n't see polygamy as a value among minorities in the u.s. hawaii was different , as the legislature made changes against marriage for gays , while the stayed decision was being appealed to the supreme court . so is casual sex and rabies . we do n't judge something as good simply because it is natural . single parenthood is not viewed as the moral traditional ideal among conservatives . they do n't ask them about polygamy . also gays rights is more political than anything else . it does n't really matter does it . we 'll see in the end who 's right . single parent is natural . many husbands die early . that 's natural . __unwed__ mothers is not considered moral but it 's still natural . casual sex is natural but not rational . it will lead to other problems . rabies are viruses . rabies are n't even alive so how can __s1__ call that natural ?
ref_sum ->  s2 claims that marriage is defined as a family unit based on a heterosexual contract . __s1__ refutes this assertion , citing a number of countries which recognize same-sex marriage and compares the lack of reproductive potential for homosexual couples to a heterosexual couple that chooses not to have children or is unable to have children . he also argues that single parent families are not considered traditional and references a poll showing support for gay rights among the 18 - 29 demographic . s2 claims that a traditional family is composed of a husband and wife and that the laws of other countries are irrelevant to the laws of america . he argues that single parent families are natural and suggests that time will decide which side is right .

ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that the issue of same-sex marriage is an economic issue because it would have negative effects on businesses , social security , and the healthcare systems . he compares homosexual partners to roommates and and demonstrates that you can not make marriage mean whatever you want by explaining that he is not legally allowed to marry his dog . he makes it clear that he believes same-sex marriage is wrong and claims that the majority of americans are also against same-sex marriage . s2 suggests that homosexual partners would not be a burden on the mentioned systems because they would be paying into the systems as well as receiving benefits from them . he cites the legalization of same-sex marriages in various other countries in europe and north america .

Article ->  they did leave in a very key statement in the provision essentially making it __non-mandatory__ to some extent '' but it also says marriage officers need not perform a ceremony between same-sex couples if doing so would conflict with his or her '' conscience , religion and belief . '' -lrb- at least they have recognized that making officials do that may be infringing on their religious freedom . the link does n't work . this is unfortunate if it applies to public officials . s2 believe public officials are there to serve all members of the public , equally under the law . that 's their job . s2 is glad they have to do their job in canada . would __http__ want a public servant to refuse __http__ because he or she does not share __http__ 's evangelical beliefs , __jyoshu__ ? __s1__ certainly would not want someone forced to do something against their religious beliefs . if __s1__ went to a public official and it were against their religious belief to perform a heterosexual civil ceremony , __s1__ had simply find someone that would , rather than try to force that person to do it . here 's the corrected link , by the way if one ca n't do the job , one should look for another job . apparently not , in south africa . __s1__ do n't see why marriage freedom should automatically trump religious freedom , and apparently sa feels the same way . do __s1__ agree with me then , that this is an impediment to the public servant doing his or her job ? this is nonsense . s2 is glad s2 live in canada , where the religion of others is not imposed into s2 's life .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ cites a key statement in the same-sex marriage legislation that allows marriage officers the right not to perform a same-sex marriage if it conflicts with their conscience , religion , or beliefs . he believes this is a good caveat , claiming that forcing officials to perform same-sex marriages would be infringing upon their religious freedom . he argues that if a public official had a religious objection to heterosexual marriages , then he would not expect that person to perform his marriage and would instead seek out someone who would . s2 believes it is inappropriate for public officials to be able to deny services based on their personal religious beliefs . if they are unable to do their job , he suggests , they should not be able to hold that position .

Article ->  sorry , but people have certain natural rights -- keeping people from being religious infringes on that . __s1__ is not saying businesses ca n't legally do it -- they can -- __s1__ is saying __s1__ think it 's pretty unethical . it 's easy for __s1__ to sit back and say what __s1__ are saying when __s1__ dislike religion , but this is no different than an employer telling a gay employee they ca n't express themselves as being gay on the job . one is discrimination for being gay , the other is discrimination for being religious . if __s1__ are going to be for equality , then be for equality in all cases . not just picking and choosing __s1__ 's pet issues . once again __jyoshu__ ; s2 manage a fast food __resturant__ . do __s1__ agree that s2 do not have to serve boy scouts and evangelical __christains__ ? s2 's moral beliefs are against them s2 should have the right to turn away their business . after all they go against s2 's religious beliefs so s2 can refuse to serve , or even hire them . right ? if s2 use __s1__ 's logic s2 should __beable__ to do whatever s2 want and use s2 's religious beliefs as an excuse . mistaken notion ? she said clearly '' __s1__ have worked on plenty of legislation ... we enact the will of the people '' it sounds to me like she 's a legislator . that 's certainly the way it comes across -- how could s2 possibly take that any other way ? a better analogy would be if s2 were trying to force a jewish employee , whom s2 knew was jewish , to work on his sabbath rather than being willing to work with him about that . or to suddenly tell him he has to eat a pork sandwich or something . and remember , this is a different issue than __benignly__ serving food . we are talking about a major religious issue here -- gay marriage , to religious people , is like asking them to approve most any bad thing in society s2 can think of . s2 have to take the seriousness of the religious view into account here somewhat . why ? it is not s2 's problem they have evil religious values . do they work for the state or god ? does god pay their paychecks or do the taxpayers ? they just have to sign a civil contract . so what if that person is the only person able to do marriage contracts in the area . how does the state ensure that gay people can __exersize__ their right to marriage if the only person able to perform the marriage is exempted from __perfoming__ the marriage based upon religious beliefs ? __s1__ just think s2 are viewing this the wrong way -- making it more complicated than it is . it is simply a provision that allows a person to let someone else conduct the civil ceremony if their religious beliefs do n't allow them to do it . the same idea that would allow a jewish person to pass on eating pork if it were suddenly expected for him or her to do it when it was n't before . that 's all this is -- let 's not make mountains out of __molehills__ ... yet what if there is no one else in the community ? how is the government going to ensure gay people are able to __exersize__ their rights ? well , then __s1__ guess they need to ensure someone is there that will do it as well . gee , that darn religious freedom -- messing everything up , huh ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing a seemingly pending law that would permit marriage officials to decline to conduct gay marriages if they are opposed to them on religious principals . __s1__ finds it acceptable , while s2 complains about it . __s1__ proposes that it is easy for s2 to be unsympathetic because s2 dislikes religion . __s1__ acknowledges that he considers such religious objections to be evil . he suggests that because the individual licensed to perform a marriage is paid or licensed by the state , the individual should reflect the will and choices of the state and therefore perform gay marriages despite his or her personal religious objection to them . s2 suspects that the law may result in an effective denial of gay marriage .
generated -> s1 is not saying businesses ca n't legally do it to sit back and say what s1 are saying when s1 dislike religion , but this is no different than an employer telling a gay employee they ca n't legally do it . if s1 are going to be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality , then be for equality in all cases that

Article ->  who are __s1__ to say it is unjust ? who are 5 people to say a law is unjust ? we have a system that says the most votes for something wins . . we are the ones being oppressed by the majority that is who we are . it is our lives that are on the ballot and our rights that our being denied that is who we are . we are the ones who are being told we are second __calss__ citizens . we are the ones who are being told are families are not families . we are the ones who are told we are less then dirt . of course being a heterosexual __s1__ would not understand . __s1__ suggest s2 get a majority of people and change the law then . this is what happened during slavery ... they actually passed 3 amendments about it . the courts are n't the all knowing group of people that have enlightened minds about what is or is n't fair . s2 's whole case is based on saying the majority is always be ignored if someone objects to them . __s1__ am in the minority when it comes to abortion ... does this mean the court should listen to me and declare abortion illegal ? no because abortion does not effect __s1__ 's life personally . that __iis__ __waht__ we mean the courts should look at the __individuials__ life and decide upon that . if a law that the majority favors is unjust in an __individuials__ life then it must be over ruled for the __individuials__ sake . what ? that makes no sense . if a law is unjust to one person then it needs to be overruled ? of course __unjustice__ is defined by the person in question . s2 make no sense here . s2 still fail to understand how our courts work too . s2 want them to work a certain way as opposed to the way they were created under our constitution . __s1__ want a society that __oppresses__ people . if the law effects even one person __adversly__ then it is unjust and needs to be overturned . it only goes to prove that conservatives are heartless and want people to suffer . __s1__ want a society that is free to make laws and rules as it sees fit . __s1__ guess we __oppress__ child __molesters__ but __s1__ am ok with that .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ , a heterosexual , and s2 , a homosexual , discuss the !!__justness__!! of the legislative process , majority rule , and how the latter affects individuals and the gay community . s2 describes how the gay community is discriminated against , and !!__posits__!! that because laws regarding homosexuals impact them more directly than the general population , it is unfair to have a majority rule apply . __s1__ accuses s2 of not understanding the legal system and proposes that s2 find majority to have legislation passed , and not look to the courts to redress the discrimination . __s1__ !!__analogizes__!! that process to how slavery was abolished , and also !!__analogizes__!! the alleged oppression to the oppression that may be felt by anti-abortion advocates and child !!__molesters__!! as a result of majority rule .
generated -> unjust ? we are the ones who are being told are families are not families . s1 suggest s2 get a majority of people and change the law then . if a law is unjust to one person then it needs to be overruled ? no because abortion does not effect s1 's life personally that

Article ->  __s1__ wish . but however much __s1__ disagree with sullivan on many political issues , he 's right about that . the world did change when the mass. legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights . it may be a big change in a small state , but it is a recognition that the winds of change are blowing against homophobic bigotry . __s1__ are just going to have to get over it . the world just is n't as anti-gay as it used to be . and that means that __s1__ are going to have to accept equal rights eventually , as gay marriage . presumably __s1__ will hope than in a few years , bigots in massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality . __s1__ think you 'll be out of luck . __s1__ wish that s2 wish . do __s1__ just like to argue for the sake of being argumentative ? __s1__ have picked out the one single thing s2 said there that __s1__ could disagree with and are making an issue of it , not even willing to agree on anything else s2 said . but fine , go ahead and think this is some __world-changing__ event if it makes __s1__ feel better . well , clearly __s1__ did n't even read s2 's post . -lrb- shrug -rrb- s2 have often posted here that s2 oppose gay marriage . that means s2 oppose equal rights for gays . if s2 have changed s2 's mind , and hope that massachusetts does n't overturn gay marriage , s2 would have said so . since s2 did n't , s2 do n't . no , __s1__ said __s1__ s2 '' will hope than in a few years , bigots in massachusetts will find enough votes to overturn equality '' . s2 had said , very plainly , that s2 think such legislation is an __over-intrusion__ by the government . clearly __s1__ did n't read s2 's post . are s2 claiming now s2 are in favour of legal marriage for gays in massachusetts now the legislature has voted for it ? because if so , that would be a change . s2 is saying that s2 would not want an amendment put in place banning it , because that would be an __over-intrusion__ into peoples ' lives by the government . so naturally , s2 would n't want such an amendment voted into creation , either , and that 's why s2 took issue with __s1__ 's claim that s2 would . that 's been s2 's position here for as long as s2 remember . and it 's a true conservative position -lrb- as opposed to __neocon__ -rrb- , __btw__ . are s2 saying that s2 are not in favour of a government ban on gay marriage ? s2 oppose doma laws ? does that mean s2 are now , contrary to s2 's previous posts , in favour of legal recognition of gay marriage ?
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 are discussing a legislative action associated with a massachusetts court ruling which is favorable to gay rights . __s1__ is enthusiastic about the matter and sees it as a step in the right direction against bigotry , and a recognition that the world is not as anti-gay as it used to be , which s2 is advised to acknowledge and accept . __s1__ also accuses s2 of being inconsistent in having been on the record on the website opposing gay marriage -lrb- and !!__therefor__!! according to __s1__ being opposed to equal rights for gays -rrb- , but now also taking a position that the state should not intervene to ban gay marriage . s2 defends that position and argues it is based on conservative principles against intrusions into individual lives .
generated -> the world did change when the mass. legislature ratified a court decision for equal rights . it may be a big change in a small state , but it may be a big change in a small state , but it is a recognition that the winds of change are blowing against homophobic bigotry .

Article ->  certainly not yours . s2 should know that __s1__ am for no marriage in government . it should be left to a religious institution where it will actually mean something . the states should then go back to doing something that actually makes sense and does n't reward people like britney spears for being white trash . that is all well and good , but it is not the religious ceremony and sanction that gays are looking for . they already have that ; there are churches that perform same-sex marriages . it is the civil benefits that are at issue . are __s1__ saying __s1__ would be in favor of __foregoing__ all the legal rights and benefits __s1__ are afforded by marriage ? for example * assumption of spouse s pension * automatic inheritance * automatic housing lease transfer * bereavement leave * burial determination * child custody * crime victim s recovery benefits * divorce protections * domestic violence protection * exemption from property tax on partner s death * immunity from testifying against spouse * insurance breaks * joint adoption and foster care * joint bankruptcy * joint parenting -lrb- insurance coverage , school records -rrb- * medical decisions on behalf of partner * certain property rights * reduced rate memberships * sick leave to care for partner * visitation of partner s children * visitation of partner in hospital or prison * wrongful death -lrb- loss of consort -rrb- benefits what do s2 say ? yeah __s1__ know . __s1__ is saying that there should be a better system . for example , if had a best friend who are roommates with ... both __hetero__ for the sake of argument ... and never wish to get married then could they get some of the benefits described ? __s1__ 's uncle actually was single until he died but he had a female friend who he was best friends with ... why could n't they get some kind of benefits if they so choose ? hospital __vistiation__ rights and things of that nature are obviously the most important in this kinda situation . it just seems the single folks are the ones getting screwed over in the marriage deal but gay folks are not ? to the single folks , s2 say get married . ok , lets use that logic ... . to the gay folks __s1__ say marry a woman . bet s2 are n't happy with that if want the benefits of marriage , get married . but ought to be able to marry a person of 's choice . 's suggestion would be to marry someone s2 do n't want to me married to , that is a different thing . it is not using '' that logic '' . s2 thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you . is n't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities ? s2 am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly . s2 happen to think that 's a bad idea . people get married for many reasons , some of which s2 would feel are not good reasons , but s2 would not make it illegal to do so . s2 am talking about the right to marry a person of 's choosing .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ and s2 discuss the civil benefits of marriage and how they could or could not be extended to single people and gay people . __s1__ is initially against government being involved in the equation , but after s2 describes many of the legal rights and benefits associated with marriage , such as automatic inheritance and hospital visitation rights , __s1__ is then able to relate to the issues by considering the case of his life-long bachelor uncle , suggesting that it is single people who are discriminated against by being excluded from the marriage benefits . s2 suggests that if a single person desires the benefits of marriage , they should marry , but that they should be able to marry a person of either gender as they see fit .
generated -> s2 should know that s1 am for no marriage in government . the states should then go back to doing something that actually makes sense and does n't reward people like britney spears for being white trash . it is the civil benefits that are at issue .

Article ->  __s1__ find it curious that every time someone makes the correct assertion that aids became an epidemic in the us through the gay community , gays and their pc __apologists__ immediately try to deflect the argument and want to talk about africa . __s1__ do n't give a flying f @ # $ about how it spread in africa ; __s1__ is talking about the usa . show me that __s1__ 's assertion is inaccurate and __s1__ will apologize , but do n't join the rest of the __apologists__ in trying to change the debate . the topic is aids in the us , not africa , not asia , not the south pole . the reason we bring up africa is to knock down the reason __s1__ bring up the stats in the us . __s1__ did n't just come along and start a chat about the progression of aids in the us . __s1__ threw it out as justification for those who oppose gay rights . if __s1__ want to use it like a weapon against gays - then expect tit for tat , jp . the topic is gay marriage in the usa . what part of that topic includes africa ? please try to keep up . statements like the above make s2 look __flighty__ . its __s1__ 's logic we are __refuting__ - location is irrelevant . location sure as hell is relevant . if __s1__ tell s2 that a bus hit a bunch of people in new york , why would s2 retort with 2 buses hit a group of people in africa ? it is an obvious attempt to deflect the focus away from the first statement , is it not ? it 's not __s1__ 's logic that s2 are trying to refute , s2 are trying to deflect the topic away from how aids spread in the us . if s2 want to refute __s1__ 's statement , show me some facts , not wishes , opinions , feelings , or other means of subterfuge . i 'll say it again for you . aids reached critical mass and became an epidemic in the us primarily via the gay community . if s2 do n't agree , show proof to support the contrary . it should n't be that difficult . if __s1__ is nothing but a __gay-bashing__ bigot who makes wild claims , then surely s2 can refute __s1__ 's claim with facts pertaining to the topic in bold , ca n't you ? but , if __s1__ is actually not a __gay-bashing__ bigot and have the facts to back up __s1__ 's claim , then s2 had better continue with the subterfuge , deflection and dismissals because all s2 will have is fraudulent pc rhetoric . s2 would n't unless __s1__ were using it as justification to ban buses in new york . exactly the point s2 am trying to make to , jp . thank you .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that the gay community is the cause of the aids epidemic in the us and that homosexuals and their advocates attempt to divert attention from this fact by tracing the origin of the disease to africa . he believes that the existence of aids in africa has nothing to do with aids in the us and that it should be ignored . s2 argues that discussing aids in africa is relevant to aids in the us and point out how aids is used as a justification for those who oppose gay rights . he suggests that the statistics regarding aids in africa show that it is not simply a homosexual disease and that aids should therefore not be used as a justification to make gay marriage illegal .

ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that his opposition to gay marriage is based on the belief that it will hurt more people than it helps , not on bigotry . he suggests that it would hurt people with a traditional view of marriage as between a man and a woman , and that the benefits of marriage can be gained by homosexuals without redefining marriage . s2 argues that gay marriage does not hurt anyone , straight or gay , and offending proponents of traditional marriage is not a valid argument against it . he believes that preventing gay marriage is simply faith based hate . he claims that having separate rules for straight and gay marriage creates the possibility of those rules being different for the two groups , allowing the gay minority to be disenfranchised .

Article ->  it seems to me that the point there is that it is not a bigot ... er , spade merely because __s1__ call it a spade . __imo__ , if someone has to resort to name-calling , it tends to only indicate they are having to resort to something besides sound arguments . oh my . perhaps we should say it 's an anti-gay bias , or a person with an __anit-gay__ bias ? are the terms __acceptance-challenged__ , __inclusion-challenged__ , anti-discrimination challenged , appealing to you ? e __mutz__ or his '' joe '' , assumed those protesting against gay discrimination are nuts or trying to hijack heritage , but wo n't say why . if it walks like a duck and __quacks__ like a duck , chances are ... or maybe he 's simply arguing a different point than you . __imo__ it 's just simply arrogant of s2 to automatically write off disagreement as '' bigotry '' . your view is that this is about '' acceptance '' ; but that does n't mean that 's the real issue . e __mutz__ is right in saying that disagreement is not the same as bigotry . what is the basis for the disagreement or the different point of view if it is not a lack of acceptance of homosexuality or its visible and open displays and representations ? but the problem is that s2 insist on always __mischaracterizing__ that as bigotry . it 's a very ugly word , and __s1__ suspect that 's the reason s2 use it -lrb- for its effect -rrb- and why s2 do n't entertain the idea that bigotry may not always be what 's behind it . s2 say it is , and s2 explain why . replace the word '' gay '' with another minority , and tell me it is not . it 's an ugly thing . s2 have explained why s2 believe that 's what 's behind it . if __s1__ believe do n't believe that , why do n't __s1__ tell me what is behind it ? __s1__ think it all goes back to one 's motivations . what __s1__ do n't think s2 and some others understand is that people often do n't take that stand on the basis of not liking gay people . they do it because of the way they view marriage . if any other minority came along wanting marriage to be changed from one man and one woman , __s1__ suspect they had get the same response . we were n't just discussing marriage specifically . somehow whenever gays are involved , a group of people take a stand of being opposed , because of the way they view one thing or another in society , as being __straight-only__ , or excluding gays . yes , from the anti-gay crowd , sorry those who do n't wish to include gays . however , no other identified minority would want that , because only one minority identifies as gay . but it 's not always about __not-including-gays__ . that 's not the basis in many cases . -lrb- hey , that rhymes ! -rrb- it 's about the way they view marriage ! they had be that way toward any group wanting to change marriage to fit themselves if it changed marriage from the traditional view . __s1__ assure s2 if there was a movement afoot in this country by __polygamists__ to change marriage to include them , there would be a similar reaction toward that . it 's not that s2 are gay . it 's that s2 want to redefine marriage . ah , there 's no use . __s1__ have tried to get s2 to see this before .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ claims that it is inappropriate to label disagreement as bigotry , and that while someone might think an argument is bigoted , it may be motivated by something other than bigotry . he argues that many people 's opinions are based on their view of marriage , not their dislike of homosexuals , and that they would be against any group wanting to alter the traditional view of marriage . s2 claims that opponents of gay rights are discriminatory and bigoted . he suggests that if you replaced gays with another minority , then the arguments against them would appear negative -lrb- e. g. , trying to exclude any other minority from getting married would not be acceptable -rrb- . he believes that opponents of gay marriage are not protecting traditional marriage , but are discriminating against homosexuals .

ref_sum ->  __s1__ challenges s2 to debate the cause of the spread of aids in the united states and encourages s2 to attempt to challenge his claims with proof that they are untrue . he accuses s2 of attempting to change the debate and making personal attacks rather than addressing the question at hand . he suggests that if the debate occurs , he will prove his assertions true . s2 claims that the origin of aids in the united states is unknown and that the spread of aids was caused by unclean needles , unprotected sex , and contaminated blood transfusions . he rejects the requirement that he should provide proof for his claims by citing __s1__ 's failure to do so . he suggests that once __s1__ begins to debate appropriately , then he will too .
generated -> the debate will start once s1 personally own up to s1 's own requirements of others . until then , s2 will continue to note the hypocrisy in s1 expecting others to defend something when s1 yourself are unwilling .

Article ->  maybe that 's because __s1__ 's family represents the norm , not a deviation from the norm . yeah , diversity sure sucks , does n't it ? yep , __perversity__ sure does . __;-rrb-__ what is perverse in __s1__ 's view ? that which is n't the norm , that which is diverse ? it 's a very long list , so s2 doubt __s1__ believe this . __s1__ hate a particular form of diversity gays . assume too much . as __s1__ have pointed out before , __s1__ do n't hate gays , __s1__ just do n't believe that we should redefine marriage for them . period . __s1__ call me or a family s2 may have , a perversion -lrb- sorry the word was '' __perversity__ '' -rrb- , but that is not hate ? s2 believe s2 am probably younger than you , but that does n't mean s2 was born yesterday . s2 can believe what s2 want , no matter how wrong s2 are .
ref_sum ->  __s1__ points out that his !!__heteronormative__!! family represents the norm and suggests that deviation from the norm in the form of homosexual families is perverse . he !!__clarifies__!! that he does n't hate gays , but he simply does n't believe that the definition of marriage should be changed to include homosexual unions . he claims that s2 's beliefs do not make him correct . s2 suggests that deviation from the norm is simply a form of diversity and is not necessarily perverse . he accuses __s1__ of hating homosexuals . in response to __s1__ 's claims that he does not hate homosexuals , s2 points out that calling homosexual relationships perverse is clearly a form of hate , and that it is clear from __s1__ 's language that he does in fact hate people who are homosexual .
generated -> yep , perversity sure does n't mean s2 was born yesterday . yeah , diversity sure sucks , does n't mean s2 was born yesterday . s2 can believe what s2 want , no matter how wrong s2 are .
