The number of earthquales that have happened outside of Israel in the last 100 yrs is exponentially increased. Believe what S1 will. If S1 have a better understanding of love waxing cold S1  had like to hear it. Obviously we don't have the smae understanding of the US government. Teh majority rules unless it violates the constitution. If S1 can point out how that isn't true then S1  had be interested in being enlightened. LOL. OK, if S2 say so. Waxy looked at the lists of " World's Most Dangerous Earthquakes and Selected Earthquakes in the United States " from The Citizen's Guide to Geologic Hazards. S1 thought it best to look just at the larger earthquakes to reduce the dependence on instruments and observers. There has been about 20 large earthquakes globally in the latter half of this century ( so far ) compared to about 15 for the first half of this century. There were only 7 large earthquakes recorded for the entire 19th century. Based on this quick look at one source of information, it does appear that the frequency of earthquakes is increasing. Mana'ia, S2 can only shake S2's at S1 sometimes. Did the idea of how they detect and record earthquakes taking exponential leaps forward ever occur to you? Of course not, S2 saw a stat that S2 liked, from one source, and without any critical thought at all, S2 immediately accepted it as being solid truth / evidence and based an entire argument on it. It is rather typical of S2's posts though. Waxy ACtually S1 did take taht fact inot consideration. The new methoods detect min or earthquakes and mostly do it in remote places. S1  is talking ab out teh major earthquakes taht could be detected wihtout a seizmograph in the major countries in the civilized world. The evidence of teh earthquakes that could be measured in the 1800 s in teh countries documented compared to thiose same earthquakes now are expontially increasing. We doin ; t need to count the minor ones in remote places. Go to ANY and ALL sources and count them. S1 did S1's research but  obviously didn't. Still remember that  also are only specualting thqat it the reason for more. Mana'ia, See S2's first response to S1's earthquake nonsense. Research hey Waxy That is the only argument S2 have but it isn't supported by the facts. Show me if S2 can that it isn't. Also S2  are only specualting especially after S2 claimed it wasn't true.

S1 claims that the number of earthquakes occurring outside of Israel has increased in the last hundred years, comparing 20 large earthquakes in the latter half of the 20th century to only 15 large earthquakes in the first half of the 20th century, and only 7 large earthquakes in the entire 19th century.
@highlight
S1 argues that this information is clear evidence that the frequency of earthquakes is increasing over time.
@highlight
S2 refutes S1 claim of increasing earthquake frequency, suggesting that the greater number of earthquakes detected could be a matter of increases in our ability to detect earthquakes rather than an actual increase in the number of earthquakes occurring.
@highlight
S1 takes this point into consideration, but claims that the evidence still supports his original claim.
