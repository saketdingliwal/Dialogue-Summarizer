Most Christians don't try to do that to gay people either. Sure they do. A majority of self-identified Christians in THIS country oppose civil marriage for gay people. In Spain, for example, they don't. A huge majority of self-identified " evangelical Christians " oppose gay marriage, civil unions, gay adoption, anti-discrimination laws, the Lawrence decision to decriminalize same-sex sex, etc., etc., etc. As S2 recall, that predeliction knows no national borders. Oh, S2 know, they  are not trying to ban really important things.... y a w n But they  are not trying to ban it. That was the accusation made. Have S1 not heard of the state constitutional amendments being passed to preclude same-sex marriage AND civil unions? Evangelical Christendom is trying to BAN gay people? Wow, S1 wish all evangelicals really WERE that united for something. Sure ; but that's not what we  are talking about, now is it? S2 were asking about the gay pride industry. LOL! No, S2 all blew S2's credibility on that claim long ago. Gay lobbyists have LONG stepped over that line in the sand ( of simply " counter-attacking " ). S1  are losing S1's touch. what do S2 mean by THAT?
@highlight
S1 does not believe that most Christians are trying to ban homosexual unions, and that those accusing them of doing so are doing so falsely.
@highlight
They believe that homosexual lobbyists have gone beyond being defensive and are actively attempting to attack evangelical Christiandom falsely in order to justify their arguments.
@highlight
S2 believes that the majority of self-identified Christians in the United States in fact, do oppose civil unions for homosexual citizens.
@highlight
However, they point out that in other countries such as Spain, they might not, but in general, the belief is the same globally.
@highlight
They refute S1's claims that they are not trying to ban homosexual unions by pointing out that the state constitutional amendments being passed are intended to preclude same-sex marriage and civil unions.
