Certainly not yours. S2 should know that S1 am for no marriage in government. It should be left to a religious institution where it will actually mean something. The states should then go back to doing something that actually makes sense and doesn't reward people like Britney Spears for being white trash. That is all well and good, but it is not the religious ceremony and sanction that gays are looking for. They already have that ; there are churches that perform same-sex marriages. It is the civil benefits that are at issue. Are S1 saying S1 would be in favor of foregoing ALL the legal rights and benefits S1 are afforded by marriage? For example * Assumption of Spouse s Pension * Automatic Inheritance * Automatic Housing Lease Transfer * Bereavement Leave * Burial Determination * Child Custody * Crime Victim s Recovery Benefits * Divorce Protections * Domestic Violence Protection * Exemption from Property Tax on Partner s Death * Immunity from Testifying Against Spouse * Insurance Breaks * Joint Adoption and Foster Care * Joint Bankruptcy * Joint Parenting ( Insurance Coverage, School Records ) * Medical Decisions on Behalf of Partner * Certain Property Rights * Reduced Rate Memberships * Sick Leave to Care for Partner * Visitation of Partner s Children * Visitation of Partner in Hospital or Prison * Wrongful Death ( Loss of Consort ) Benefits What do S2 say? yeah S1 know. S1  is saying that there should be a better system. For example, if  had a best friend who  are roommates with... both hetero for the sake of argument... and never wish to get married then could they get some of the benefits  described? S1's Uncle actually was single until he died but he had a female friend who he was best friends with... why couldn't they get some kind of benefits if they so choose? Hospital vistiation rights and things of that nature are obviously the most important in this kinda situation. It just seems the single folks are the ones getting screwed over in the marriage deal But gay folks are not? To the single folks, S2 say get married. Ok, lets use that logic.... To the gay folks S1 say marry a woman. Bet S2 aren't happy with that If  want the benefits of marriage, get married. But  ought to be able to marry a person of 's choice. 's suggestion would be to marry someone S2 don't want to me married to, that is a different thing. It is not using " that logic ". S2 thought marriage was supposed to mean something to you. Isn't it supposed to mean a commitment with rights and responsibilities? S2 am not proposing that anyone enters into that commitment lightly. S2 happen to think that's a bad idea. People get married for many reasons, some of which S2 would feel are not good reasons, but S2 would not make it illegal to do so. S2 am talking about the right to marry a person of 's choosing.

S1 and S2 discuss the civil benefits of marriage and how they could or could not be extended to single people and gay people.

S1 is initially against government being involved in the equation, but after S2 describes many of the legal rights and benefits associated with marriage, such as automatic inheritance and hospital visitation rights, S1 is then able to relate to the issues by considering the case of his life-long bachelor uncle, suggesting that it is single people who are discriminated against by being excluded from the marriage benefits.
@highlight
S2 suggests that if a single person desires the benefits of marriage, they should marry, but that they should be able to marry a person of either gender as they see fit.
