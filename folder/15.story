We don't just benefit from what is often considered the common, nuclear family. We benefit from families with adopted children, step children, families with no children at all. No it does not. Prove it will come up, and also prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage. Marriage is that now. S2  are right, it has nothing to do with the Bible. It has everything to do with the slippery slope logical fallacy, which we have discussed in the forum ad nauseum. It only shows that those opposed do not have an argument. S2 know the prospect of incest and polygamy is much less socially acceptable than gay marriage, so S2 try to erroneously tie polygamy and incest to gay marriage in people's mind to strike fear in them, and hope their logical reasoning can be replaced by irrational fear. a married couple as the head of a home is considered a nuclear family it already has. the question of legality is what this whole issue is about. marriage is a legal instituation, how could legality NOT come up. yes it is whoa... hold up... are S1 saying that only because gay marriage is less unacceptable that incestuous relations, that its ok to grant gay marriage but not sibling marriage?? if the incestuous society begin to parade and protest, until society accepts them on the level that they accept gays now, what will S1 say then? on what grounds should we discriminate against 2 siblings wanting to get married, particularly if they believe they truly love each other, or if they believe that they were born with that attraction? this is classic hypocracy. if 2 siblings want to love each other in their private lives, how is that any business of yours? and what does irrational fear have to do with anything? do S1 have an irrational fear of an incestuous or polygamous lifestyle? based on what? give me one reason why society shouldnt accept an incestuous relation between two consenting adults Then what may lead to incest and polygamy is the fact that marriage is a legal institution, is that what S2 are saying? If so, these things may come up equally as a result of straight legal marriage or gay legal marriage or interracial legal marriage, or legal inter-faith marriage or legal marriage with legal divorce, etc. It doesn't relate specifically to gay legal marriage at all. S1 was saying this is how many people attempt an argument against gay marriage, by attempting to incite fear by spouting off a parade of horribles that have nothing to do with the issue of gay marriage. What if straight people are married and winged green monkeys come flying out of everyone's derriere in the future? What will S2 do then? Demonstrate how gay marriage specifically relates to incest and incestuous marriage and polygamy. This is the gay rights forum, not the incest forum. thats not what im saying. what may lead to incestuous marriage is if siblings or related people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage. and what may lead to polygamous marriage is 3 or more people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage. do S1 see a pattern here? ooooh.. nice way to snake out of the issue... let me refresh S1's memory since S1 brought it up, what exactly does the social acceptance of any type of " taboo " relationship have to do with their right to be legally married? is there a certain limit of " tabooness ", and if youre past that limit then no marriage for you? and what fear are S1 talking about? S2  is talking about people that love each other and want to tie the knot. how could that possibly strike fear in somebody? please.... Yes, that's true. Yes, that's true. Are S2 saying love is the pattern? Well, love applies to straight marriages as well as gay marriages. Love is not exclusive to gay marriages. If that's the connection, we can just as easily say straight marriage will lead to incestuous marriage and polygamy. S2 are saying love will cause a slippery slope. It's still fallacious. The issue S1 brought up was why this fallacy is often used, that is to create fear, because incest and polygamy are indeed considered so taboo. The issue is not the tabooness of anything and everything, but how it is being used to distract from the issue of same-sex marriage, when there isn't a logical, rational argument against same-sex marriage. It's an indication of desperation on the part of some of those who are against same-sex marriage. S1 have no reason to discuss the level of acceptability or lack thereof of every single thing, before S1 accept one thing that is different from all those other things. S1 can deal with that one thing on all of its own merits and shortfalls, without being drawn into a false dilemma, either accept everything or else don't accept one thing, as if those are the only two choices, fallacy. gay marriage will change the definition of marriage from " a legal union between a man and a woman " to " a legal union between any parties that love each other ". if its ok for 2 people that love each other and want to tie the knot, then how could incest be a taboo? based on what? again with the double standard. gay marriage was considered just as much a taboo as incest or polygamy just a few years ago. being gay emerged from its taboo status through parades, promotional efforts, and, unfortunately, by spreading lies ( i'll deal with that in another thread ). however, incestuous people didnt go through the process of parading their lifestyle in front of the world and practically begging for approval from society. so incest is still deeper in taboo status than homosexuality. why is it ok to deny incestuous relations the right to marry on the grounds that it is considered taboo, but ok to approve gay marriage on the same grounds?
@highlight
S1 and S2 are debating whether making gay marriage legal will open opportunities for other "taboos" in our society.
@highlight
S1 believes that in opening this opportunity for gay marriage, the definition of marriage will change and it will allow other issues like incest and polygamy to become legal.
@highlight
S2 accuses S1 of hypocracy.
@highlight
In a sense, they believe gay marriage will have a sort of domino effect for other issues.
@highlight
S1 is arguing that using these other issues to be evidence for why gay-marriage shouldn't be allowed is not a valid argument.
@highlight
Then S1 goes on to say that this tactic is used to instill fear to those who do not support those other issues.
@highlight
S1 understands the other issues, but doesn't see the relationship between those and that of same-sex marriage.
@highlight
S2 keeps arguing that it shouldnt be different figuring out whether one can approve gay marriage but not incest since they believe the two to be somewhat related.
