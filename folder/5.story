This site shows a large range of historical instances of gay marriage. Romans did it, so did celts, greeks This one focuses on marriage in american-indian tribes, and how the homosexuals were actually greatly valued as healers and prophets. Just take a look at the Old Testament to find marriages between one man and many women. Polygamy is also present in African and Islamic culture too. And in some tribes in Nigeria, there is a culture of polyandry ( one woman, many men ). So marriage is not some one man, one woman thing that has been adhered to since time began. As an ' ideal ', it's far more recent that http might think. Smiley Marriage has always been about different genders. S2 made no mention of solely one to one. If http look closely at history http will find that marriage ( a couple of Bhuddist sects apart ) has always been between opposite genders. There have been cultures where homosexual relationships have existed for short periods and often for specific cultural purposes but marriage per se has been between opposite genders. Evidently S2 didn't read the links S1 gave you. To put it another way, there are many many examples of gay marriage throughout history. This idea that it is new and abnormal is ridiculous. Smiley S2 clearly did, S2 suspect S1 may have but didn't understand. None of those unions were accepted to be marriage but unions for a particular purpose. Marriage took place later between man and woman. S1's concept is new. That's interesting!! S2 made the point about marriage having been an opposite sex institution before. S1 gave many examples of societies where same sex marriage was commonplace. S2 then said that they weren't really marriage because marriage was something new. Now S2  are saying that same sex marriage has been against society's beliefs since the year dot. So is marriage a new thing that is only a male-female thing, or is marriage something that has been around since the year dot ( and would include those examples that S1 gave - American Indian berdaches, gay marriage within early Roman society etc )? S1 assume early Roman society falls within the year-dot-till-now period. Smiley Same sex marriage has never been commonplace. There are a couple of Bhuddist sects who allow it. It was definitely frowned on in Roman Times. The Greeks had homosexual liaisons, some from desire, some for a form of mentoring reasons. They were never marriages and never assumed to be so by those Societies. Those Greek Roman Chinese and any other Society accepted certain homosexual liaisons but marriage was something else. It was between people of opposite genders and that is not new it was how it was originally
