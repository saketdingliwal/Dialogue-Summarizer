Who are S1 to say it is unjust? Who are 5 people to say a law is unjust? We have a system that says the most votes for something wins.. We are the ones being oppressed by the majority that is who we are. It is our lives that are on the ballot and our rights that our being denied that is who we are. We are the ones who are being told we are second calss citizens. We are the ones who are being told are families are not families. We are the ones who are told we are less then dirt. Of course being a heterosexual S1 would not understand. S1 suggest S2 get a majority of people and change the law then. This is what happened during slavery... they actually passed 3 amendments about it. The courts aren't the all knowing group of people that have enlightened minds about what is or isn't fair. S2's whole case is based on saying the majority is always be ignored if someone objects to them. S1 am in the minority when it comes to abortion... does this mean the court should listen to me and declare abortion illegal? No because abortion does not effect S1's life personally. That iis waht we mean the courts should look at the INDIVIDUIALS life and decide upon that. If a law that the majority favors is unjust in an individuials life then it must be over ruled for the individuials sake. What? That makes no sense. If a law is unjust to one person then it needs to be overruled? Of course unjustice is defined by the person in question. S2 make no sense here. S2 still fail to understand how our courts work too. S2 want them to work a certain way as opposed to the way they were created under our constitution. S1 want a society that oppresses people. If the law effects even one person adversly then it is unjust and needs to be overturned. IT only goes to prove that conservatives are heartless and want people to suffer. S1 want a society that is free to make laws and rules as it sees fit. S1 guess we oppress child molesters but S1 am ok with that.
@highlight
S1, a heterosexual, and S2, a homosexual, discuss the justness of the legislative process, majority rule, and how the latter affects individuals and the gay community.
@highlight
S2 describes how the gay community is discriminated against, and posits that because laws regarding homosexuals impact them more directly than the general population, it is unfair to have a majority rule apply.
@highlight
S1 accuses S2 of not understanding the legal system and proposes that S2 find majority to have legislation passed, and not look to the courts to redress the discrimination.
@highlight
S1 analogizes that process to how slavery was abolished, and also analogizes the alleged oppression to the oppression that may be felt by anti-abortion advocates and child molesters as a result of majority rule.
