Withers DC Council votes for gay marriage By James Withers, contributing editor, 365 Gay Blog 12.15.2009 pm EST In a 11 - 2 vote, the City Council of Washington, DC voted for gay marriage. We are a bit short-handed today, so expect more about this later. Until then have a sip of the bubbly and congrats to the District. Wait until it's put on a ballot for the voters to decide. This isn't the first time that a liberal government didn't pay attention to the will of the people. And what is the will of the people JP? People in support of marriage equality is steadily growing. Compare the polls from ten years ago to now to see... It is only a matter of time before equality stands upon the side of the majority. S2 keep hearing gays say that but every time it's put to a vote, S1 lose. S2  had say that it's time to try another tact because the current one is a losing proposition. The only thing forcing gay marriage on a population does is galvanize them against the forced action. And when they respond on the ballot, they do so punatively. Just wait until S1 see the repercussions of the current efforts to give ALL Federal Employee's same sex partners bennies on OUR DIME despite DOMA. S2  is guessing that some additional Democratic heads will roll in the fall election if that flies. S1 need a PR strategy that highlights the advantages of gay unions over bathhouse and gay bar existences. S2 believe that a true majority of people would support civil unions but NOT marriage. And S2 count myself amongst that majority. Actually JP so far 5 states have passed gay marriage so no not every time it is put to a vote do we lose. And how am S1 forcing anyone to accept gay marriage? Am S1 forcing these voters to attend S1's wedding or dare S1 say be in a marriage themselves? And S1 cannot agree with S2 more about changing the image of the gay community as a whole.. We are not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people running around... What S1 find funny is once strait people find out how boring we really are, and how we pay taxes just like every other joe schmo they'll think nothing more of special rights lol... But actually like S1 stated earlier in another thread if those unions constituted the same legal rights as married couples S1 would be content. Which 5 states put gay marriage on the ballot and it won? To the best of S2's knowledge, no state that has gay marriage today has ever gotten it via the ballot. It has either been the court or legislature that has forced it on the state. The gays S2 know are as boring as Mr and Mrs John Q. Public as well, but that's not the image that is portrayed to the general public. Like S2 said, S1 have a PR problem. S2 think that if more gays were willing to settle for civil unions that were more equivalent to marriage, S1  had have an easier time gaining legal acceptance. Ok maybe not the ballot... Got me there man. Lol.... Maine was a close one though. And yeah we got a MAJOR PR problem big time... And S1 said as long as we got the legal rights of marriage and called it CU S1 would be cool with that. S1 already wear a dress and heels enough as it is! lmao jk.... S2 hope that you, at least, shave S1's legs. ;) Oh S1 do... lmao naw S1 don't wear a dress S1 wouldn't look good in one...

Those opposed to gay marriage may view gays as promiscuous and sexual deviants, but most gay men are assuredly quite normal.
@highlight
Civil unions will not be accepted in place of marriage, as they do not allow the same legal rights as marriage.
@highlight
S2: Councils and legislatures may vote in favor of gay marriage, but it has yet to be the majority vote of the people.
@highlight
Gay marriage should be played in a positive light by its supporters, because the current public perception of gay men is that they are promiscuous and lead a "gay lifestyle" that is offensive.
@highlight
Anti-gay marriage supporters will support civil unions in lieu of gay marriage, and homosexuals should be satisfied with that.
