Dead " potential " lives don't have " real " or " actual " dead bodies. When a pre-birth child dies ( either naturally or by the hands of a ' doctor ' paid to kill it ),... it has a ' real ' body. Not just a mere potential for one. There are plenty of photos and such on the net if S2 really need more convincing evidence. But if S2 ever want to debate it further, feel free to join me in the appropriate threads. Are S1 finished trying to troll this thread yet for people to talk to S1 about abortion? S2 am half tempted to start playing devil's advocate and adopt YOUR positions against gay rights here as a means to respond to S1 on abortion issues in the other threads. S1 would lose abortion arguments by the arguments S1 have raised here... Food for thought. Couple a " general welfare " claim with the research that shows abortion has caused lower crime... By S1's position, and by blindly repeating " general welfare " over and over again without addressing anything, not much S1 would be left with... I'll take that debate. Anytime. Oh. S2 recognize what S1 WANTED S1's point to be... S2 also recognize how S1 flubbed up stating what S1 wanted to say... And that's where S1 went beyond being insulting. It's like trying to argue that the abortionists could have no qualms exterminating Jews in another Holocaust. S1 should at least be honest enough to admit the boundaries that DO exist, unilaterally. And by that logic, S2 could just as easily argue that those people who wanted to prevent gay marriage could just as easily want to prevent inter-religious or inter-racial marriage... They could supposedly just as easily have wanted slavery back, if they  are willing to deny people rights because of their differences... If S2 thought S1 would learn anything meaningful to S1 from such a discussion, S2 would take S1 up on it... But as it is, S2 have come to recognize S1's posting patterns enough to question how much S1 recognize the fallibility of S1's own tactics... At least we can agree on that much. S1 doubt S2 could learn anything ; also! Hey,... Will Maine's results have any bearing on the SCOTUS look at overturning the 9th ( again )? Ya think? See, that's part of the problem. That's not an issue we agree on. But S1 don't recognize that... Why should it? The " 9th " is about how the FEDERAL CONSTITUTION applies to gay marriage. Maine's results were about how voters feel about gay marriage. Two entirely separate issues... While S2 recognize the following will be lost on you, S2 offer it anyways... Bowers rationale does not withstand careful analysis. In his dissenting opinion in Bowers Justice Stevens concluded that ( 1 ) the fact a State s governing majority has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice, and ( 2 ) individual decisions concerning the intimacies of physical relationships, even when not intended to produce offspring, are a form of liberty protected by due process. LAWRENCE V. TEXAS The fact that a majority want a law is not enough to satisfy a constitutional challenge of that law. That much should be obvious. No,.. seriously.... S1 doubt S2 would learn ( accept, consider, absorb, aquire ) anything from such a debate. But, S2  are welcome to try to prove me wrong about that. California's ban ( being reviewed by the 9th ) is likewise about " the voters " and their desired definition. See what S1 mean that it's doubtful that S2 will learn anything from another exchange? S2 don't need to bother with an answer to that. S1 already know what it is likely to be. See, this is why S2 doubt S1's intellectual honesty in discourse. What S1 said was actually pretty witty, assuming it wasn't done by accident. But S1 still choose to employ those faculties for furthering flawed arguments, and dodging arguments S1 know S1 cannot win. So S1 blindly repeat yourself, and think S2 have learned nothing. They are two entirely separate issues. But S1 pointing to issue A DOES NOT REFUTE issue B. THAT is where S1 are flawed. It doesn't matter how much " desire " the voters have. Their law STILL has to be constitutional and meet the requirements of the 14th amendment. And until S1 can embrace an honestly open discussion on that, without repeating yourself ad nausieum like a skipping record player, there is no point in enjoining S1 on another subject.
@highlight
This debate is about the 9th and how the federal constitution applies to marriage.
@highlight
S1 and S2 begin by talking about trolling and potentially starting a new debate on abortion, which doesn't really have a lot of purpose in this conversation.
@highlight
S2 says that in saying people who want to get rid of gay marriage may have wanted to prevent inter-racial and inter religious marriage.
@highlight
S2 states that Maine's vote on gay marriage was an opinion on gay marriage, rather than the 9th being how the Federal Constitution applies to gay marriage.
@highlight
S2 also says that Bowers Justice Stevens doesn't have the evidence to withstand his analysis.
@highlight
They also bring up Lawrence v.
@highlight
Texas and S2 states that even when majority wants a law it isn't enough for the constitution challenge of the law.
@highlight
S2 goes back to saying how S1's arguments are flawed and that its too repetitive for this conversation, because S1 hasn't disproved anything.
@highlight
They go back to talking trash to each other and they end the conversation.
