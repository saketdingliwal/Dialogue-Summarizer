Any two adults can run the household, one can make the decision if the other is incapacitated, one inherits when the other dies, etc etc. That parallel does not carry over to group marriages. When one dies, who inherits? If one is incapacitied, who decides what the treatment should be? Basically, pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two, so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task, and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious. If we  are talking about legal recognition, and we are ( right? ), then the cases are wildly different. Our marriage laws, for better or worse, are set up on the assumption of two adults running a household. They also assume man and wife, true, but don't actually depend on that. But the dependence on there being two people is embedded in the laws ; changing that is a huge project. Yes, but gays would also want laws changed to accomodate THEIR form of marriage as well. The fact that one requires less change than the other shouldn't matter, should it? Should having to do more reworking of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality? It seems to me S1's argument boils down to " polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it. " Yeah -- such is the price for marriage equality. Let's face it -- if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for opposite-sex couples which comprise most relationships, they could pull it off -- polygamy, gays, letting 17 year olds marry, etc. All those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed. Means could be set up to determine inheritance, for example. Laws can be worded to do it. See, this is why we try to avoid this debate. Those who oppose gay marriage inevitably put their own spin on it and drag it to silly conclusion. Here we see what gays really want turned into " make marriage an open-ended institution of equality ", which then means gay, poly, and 17 year olds in this case. Jyoshu stopped there, but it's not uncommon for it then to go to children, cousins, dogs, whatever. This issue is not " let's let everyone do anything they like ", that's just the common reframing we see whenever poly relations are brought up while disscusing gay marriage. It happens all the time, it gets old, and that's why people who have gone through it a bunch of times tend to aviod the whole thing. It happens because there's no way to avoid logical conclusions. Believe it or not, cultural and legal precedent is a very real thing. The events in the article exemplify this. If S1 argue to broaden marriage ( which S1 are ), then this is what S1 have to deal with. As S1 said, S2 DID stop with polygamy, gay, and barely lowering the age of consent, so why are YOU bringing up all the other examples like " children, cousins dogs, " or whatever, as if S1 were ready to pounce on that? S1  are arguing against degrees that S2 didn't even say, or that NO one said. Now, do S1 have any response to S2's point that S1's argument boils down to nothing more than " polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it ", or are S1 just going to avoid it by getting sidetracked by the fact S1 don't like that we  are even talking about this? Again, society can deal with issues like polygamy if they really want to. Sure there is. S2 can start with an erroneous assumption, like S2 did, and then arrive at an illogical conclusion, like S2 did. Why don't S2 read the exchanges between me and Phyllis ; S1 think most of S2's issues will be addressed that way. Do S1 feel that opening marriage to gay couples is not a case of broadening marriage? How is that an erroneous assumption? Sure, but S2 asked S1 some specific questions that S1 seem to be avoiding. In S1's exchange with Phyllis S2 may comment on matters S2 disagree with. Listen to yourself! We start with " gays want to get married ", S2 change it to " make marriage an open-ended institution of equality ", and now S2 segue over to " broadening marriage ". S2's erroneous assumption is S2's statement of what gays are trying to accomplish. Until S2 stop trying to change what gays really want into something that S2 can argue against more easily all S2's arguments will be based on erroneous assumptions. Actually, S1 did address them. While debating with Phyllis. Naturally. And naturally S1 may ignore them if S1 think they are diversions. What gays are trying or not trying ( in terms of intent ) is not the issue. What is the crux here is that marriage would be broadened. It's not rocket science. S1  are moving the boundaries of what constitutes a marriage to include MORE than opposite-sex couples. Very straightforward. S2 know S1 don't like it phrased that way, but that's what it is. S1 can't take a phrase like ' gays want to get married " without looking at the overall implications. In terms of legal rights, S2 don't see why it would be any different. Equality in marriage is equality in marriage regardless of the cultural motivation -- religious, being in love with more than one person, or simply just for the hell of it. For that matter, the argument could be made that opposite-sex marriage between 2 people is largely a religious construct! I'll try to explain this to S2 one more time. The stated purpose of gays is quite relevent if S2 are trying to argue against it. Gays want to get married. One side effect of that is that some people will see the scope of marriage broadened. Gays are not, in and of itself, trying to broaden marriage. They did not wake up one day and say " let's try to broaden the scope of marriage today, that'll be fun! " S2's arguments run along the lines of " If S2 want to braoden marriage, than S2 must excpet it broadening in all these other ways " and that's why S2's rephrasing doesn't work. Broadening marriage isn't the goal, it's a side effect, and since it isn't the goal we don't have to accept all these other things S2 claim would be the result if they were trying to broaden marriage. To recap, S2's arguments are based on S2's assumption that gays want to broaden marriage, that that is their ulitmate goal, the pinnacle of the cause. Gays getting married to S2 seems to be the means to that end. That is, of course, backwards, and so S2's sematic based arguments fail. Kronos, S2 just told S1 S2 am not dealing here with what gays are trying / not trying to do in terms of intent, yet S1 are are arguing as if S2 never even said that. S2 am not arguing what gays have as intent. S2 completely understand what S1 are saying. S2's point here is based on the effect of their intents, whatever that intent is. There is simply no way to get around the fact that if S1 change marriage to include other that opposite-sex couples ( to ANY number of other possibilities -- even ONE ), S1 are broadening marriage. Whether or not gays set out out to do this in terms of a goal is irrelevant. S1 are attacking some point about intent that S2 haven't made -- S2  is talking about the effect here. To latch onto some straw man of " intent " is to completely miss the point. S1  is not ignoring this post, S1  is simply choosing not to respond because it's a pointless distraction in an otherwise interesing thread. If S2 want to start another thread on this theme I'll explain there how wrong S2 are. Well, S1  are the one that's taking issue and making it a distraction!

S1: Opposers to gay marriage often jump to conclusions about who can get married -why not cousins, group marriages, children, dogs? Polygamous marriage raises legal concerns that are not currently covered in traditional marriage laws, for example.
@highlight
The goal of gay marriage supporters is to be able to get married - not to broaden marriage.
@highlight
Broadened marriage is a side effect of legal gay marriage.
@highlight
S2: Gay marriage supporters want marriage laws changed to accommodate gay marriage.
@highlight
Broadened marriage could change the current traditional marriage laws.
@highlight
Polygamy, for example, would require more marriage laws changed than gay marriage would, as more people are involved.
@highlight
But if enough people wanted legal polygamous marriage, the laws would be passed.
@highlight
Marriage would be broadened if gay marriage is made legal, whether that is the goal of gay marriage or not.
