What about the Domionists? Do they care about other people or do they just care about POWER? S2 just did a google search and couldn't find a Dominionist Web Site at all. The only articles S2 could find on this devious organization are from radical Left leaning groups that S2 believe are making this group up as a red herring to create a reason to promote fear of Christians. Would S1 be so kind as to post a link to the Dominionist web site that outlines their agenda to take over the Country? Just go to Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson and learn what S2 need to know. So what S1  are saying is that S1 can't produce one objective, independent site or source that is by the Dominionists themselves as evidence that they are an actual existing group or organization. If S1 could, S1 would have. This is just one more example of the diabolical agenda of the Radical Left to make people fear Christianity based on more lies and deception. Thanks for revealing who the real paranoid fearmongers are. Do S2's own homework, buddy. Then stop making assertions S1 can't back up with evidence. S2 already told S1 S2 googled it and found nothing at all by a Dominionist Organization at all. But S1 implied it's a real group so prove it or else don't attempt to use it as a method of demonizing Christians as a group. The reason why S1 lefties must lie and cheat to win is because the truth is repugnent and foreign to you. And Samiinh, it's fascinating that S1 posted that article but declined to post the link. How corrupt are S1 to with hold the link because it's from a Leftist site that os promoting the lie of the Dominionist's existence without producing any more proof than S1 did. S2 could post a link on Google right now asserting that all Lefties of the Socialist, Democratic Party persuasion are in fact Satan Worshipers who sacrifice the babies they kidnap from Republican Christians on an alter to the devil at each full moon. Posting it wouldn't make it true. Even though on its surface it's much more credible than S1's bogus story about Christian Dominionists. Now post a link with S1's slanderous article or delete it for the lie that it is.
@highlight
S1 suggests that a Christian sect known as the Domionists are focused only on gaining power, citing Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson as his sources.
@highlight
S2 claims that he was unable to find any evidence of Domionists practices online except from left wing groups.
@highlight
He suggests that the Dimionists are not a real religious group, but rather are a group invented by left wing groups to make people fear Christianity, and further argues that left leaning individuals rely on lying to achieve their goals because they are unfamiliar with the truth.
@highlight
He also presents an absurd story about people on the political left being Satan worshipers in order to demonstrate how posting information without evidence to back it up does not make it automatically true.
