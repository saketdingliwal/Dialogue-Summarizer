New England and New York will probably have gay marriage within the next few years. The West Coast might also follow suit after that. S1 think the recent wave of gay marriage legalization will stop for the next 20 years or so after that. 30 states already define marriage as between a man and a woman. Don't be so sure. If Congress removes DOMA and with Roberts and Alito on the court same sex marriage will come to the rest of the country with a 7 to 2 ruling. Roberts and Alito are constitutional literalists and with DOMA out of the way the full faith and credit clause is a clear constitutional mandate. Can S2 demonstrate evidence that the SCOTUS would nullify gay marriage bans in all states? If the SCOTUS was so imposed, why don't they just strike DOMA down right now and then declare all gay marriage bans unconstitutional? Secondly, states can choose not to recognize gay marriage even without federal DOMA. There is a choice of law doctrine that allows states to not recognize other states marriages that they find " offensive " to their own public policy. States have been not recognizing each others marriages for decades and states do not use the FFC clause to make one state recognize another's marriage. There is no case history of FFC ever used in this way. Even in cases where it has been attempted, the legal argument involved is so lengthy, that it effectively prohibits FFC use due to the sheer amount of hassle and legal proceedings involved in winning such a case. It is called the constitution of the United states A marriage license is a public act and record Which http  are obviously ignorant of. http completely failed to respond to the choice of law doctrine, as well as S1's request that http provide justification on http's claims of how each Justice would vote, as well as S1's challenge to http to explain why DOMA has not been declared unconstitutional if http's claims about the Justices were true. Apparently, the law is beyond http's comprehension, as is http's ability to consider facts in forming http's opinions. In answer to S1's question. Steven, Kennedy, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer will side with us. Roberts and Alito will follow the constitution as written. Scalia and Thomas are a lost anti gay cause. That is how S2 know how they will vote. As to why DOMA has not been declared unconstitutional is because there has not been a case in the courts challenging DOMA and so has not been taken up by SCOTUS. I'll do a little research on S2's claims. Regardless, S2 still failed to address how state courts may use the choice of law doctrine so that the FFC clause does not apply, and if it were, the sheer complication of applying the law would make it effectively prohibitive. By all means, post up the FFC clause again so S2 can avoid addressing this. S2 do not see how choice of law doctrine is not trumped by the full faith and credit clause in cases of marriage contract since there is a current tradition of one state respecting other states marriage licenses when it comes to heteros. The choice of law doctrine is used to settle differences between different state laws. That is how the law is practiced, and that is what courts believe. Again, states have been disagreeing on the validity of each other's marriages for decades and there has been no case history of the full faith and credit clause that has made one state recognize another state's marriage. Courts look to the choice of law doctrine before the FF & C C.

S1: Legally, it is complicated to legalize gay marriage in all states, as DOMA is in place and states have chosen not to recognize other state's marriages for decades.
@highlight
Attempts abide by the FFC clause to in respect to marriage (even before DOMA) require such lengthy legal arguments that they are rendered prohibitive.
@highlight
The choice of law doctrine must be considered and DOMA could be found to be unconstitutional by vote of the SCOTUS.
@highlight
How will states use the choice of law doctrine so that the FFC clause does not apply? S2: If Congress removes DOMA, a vote for legal gay marriage will pass quickly, and certain justices of SCOTUS already approve of gay marriage.
@highlight
DOMA has yet to be declared unconstitutional because there has yet to be a case made to challenge DOMA in the courts, so it has not been decided upon by SCOTUS.
@highlight
The choice of law doctrine trumps the FFC clause in cases of marriage contract and there is a current tradition of respecting other states marriage licenses for.
