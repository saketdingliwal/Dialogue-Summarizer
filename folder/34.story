Should they? What are western standards? What were they 20 yrs ago? What were they 100 yrs ago? Marriage is recognizing a family unit based on a natural heterosexual contract. Where would that put families started by artificial insemination? The same as any other heterosexual couple. It's not the way children are created ( adopted, serrogacy, etc ). It ' s the nature of the relationship ( heterosexual ). Natural refers to nature not child bearing. which god enforces marriage rules when the cermony is performend by a judge? There was a tribe in the Congo that allowed it. Their shamans told them that the warriors could only marry outer warriors. To be with a women, they thought, might make then softer, and more woman like, and not as fearless in combat. Ok, so conceiving a child is not what makes it nature, what is it? Wouldn t polygamy also include some of that same sex taboo, to women marred together? Why do S1 feel S1's values are right and others that disagree as wrong? Polygamy is not women married together. It's one man or women married to multiple of the opposite sex like a harem or entourage. Everyone feels their values are right or else they wouldn't believe in them. What we value shows. Of course atheist don't believe in God so they have a different set of values. S1 of course believe in God first, family second, and country third. If S2 have different values then of course S2 will think yours are better if not then S2 wouldn't have them. Our values are what guide us. S1 feel that from perspective S1's values give someone a better balance and stability to function in society. S2 probably think otherwise but S1 feel statistically S1 can support mine. Sorry, S2 don t practice Polygamy ; S2 don t know the inner workings of the family. S2 would think it would be a good way for bi-sexual to stay below the radar. S2 worded the question badly ; S2 should have asked why do S1 feel that S1's morals should be forced on to others? By keeping the laws the way they are now it is discrimination. Correct me if S2 am wrong, but S2 did not think S1 could fire some one for being gay. It's all good S1 didn't think S2 knew what S2 were talking about anyways? The questions is why should they force their moral on us? Should we let other people like nudist and rapist force their mroals on us? How is allowing them to marry forcing there morals on us ? Yes we would have to deal with the fact of it, but the US has been dealing with the fact of Polygamy fro years. There is only one case that was prosecuted in recent history ( that was mostly due to one of his wives being 14 when married. When society legalizes behavior it is in fact accepting it as non-detrimental and accepting it. It is a form of forcing our society to accept the behavior.
