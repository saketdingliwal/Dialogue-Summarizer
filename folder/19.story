S2 do know that the gay marriage debate is not synonymous with someone condoning violence against gays, right? S1 seriously doubt anyone here doesn't agree with S2 that gays shouldn't experience violence and name-calling, so that's not even an issue on the table here. Disagree and debate those who believe gay marriage is wrong all S2 want. But don't dishonestly use arguments about violence, because no one here has argued for that. S2  is sorry, but have S1 READ ARCHIE'S POSTS??? He regularly denigrates gays with a variety of slurs. And Palin never asked for somebody to threaten Obama either. But her rhetoric INFLAMED people to extremes that are grotesque. Oh please. Don't start that subjective canard again. If every religious person who genuinely disagreed with gay marriage because of their religion added a ' but-no-violence! ' addendum to everytime they weighed in on it, do S2 think anyone actually thinks S2  had be satisfied? Um... no. it's funny how the whole violence thing gets used as a means-to-an-end tool by those who argue against religious people on this. Well, it would be funny if it weren't sad to some extent. People shouldn't have to stop standing up for their principles just because of nutcases out there. If the shoe fits... S2  is talking about the people who proclaim abusive lies about gays. People who put out junk that makes people feel threatened by gays. Telling people that gay marriage will makes their kids have to be taught about gay marriage? That's a threat. Telling people that gay marriage will require churches to have to perform gay marriages? That's perceived as a threat too. S2 have no doubt that SOME people can discuss the subject without inciting. But on the Prop 8 battle, the ads clearly WERE inciteful. Do S1 think that if a person talks about an abortion doctor " killing babies ", that doesn't push somebody to think about claiming " self-defense " or " defense of others "? How many people do S1 think are out there that have attacked a gay person that actually had somebody tell them " S2 think S1 should go out and kill a gay person "? It's built up toxicity from all the anti-gay rhetoric that reaches a boiling point. When the rhetoric inflames, it's obvious where it starts when somebody gets burned... Oh. And can S2 just say that while S2 am impressed S1 didn't try to attack me, S1  are doing a bad job of ignoring me... Yeah, WHEN it fits. Not other contexts. Jason didn't make that distinction which is why S1 took issue with him on it. S1 didn't say S1 was going to start ignoring you, Foundit. S1 made clear S1 was done with that discussion. S1 did NOT say S1 was going to stop responding to S2 Foundit. And regarding S2's comment about ' attacking ', it's because S2's tone has changed in the last few posts -- S2 have turned off the hostility some, for whatver reason, and it's the nature of things that honey draws less flies than ****. That's why S2 no longer perceive as being " attacked. " Quite simply, S2 require a fight-fire-with-fire approach, and so tone S2 are treated with ( from me, anyway ) depends entirely on you. And considering he was responding to ARCHIE, one of the guys who has got the worst track record on this message board for abusive slurs towards gays, S2 think he was right on track. Oh. Silly me. So that was just a lame attempt to dodge THAT conversation then. The one where S2 had just finished explaining how S1 were moving the goal-posts and obfuscating up a storm. S2 guess " CLAFCLO " was more successful than S2 thought. It's amusing to watch S1 turn on S1's passive-aggressive claims, and then turn them off again. When S1 need it as an excuse, you'll start whining about " attacks " again, even as S1 drop claims that S2 shouldn't be a moderator of any board... Which S2  is sure isn't an " attack " or " personal information " in S1's book, hmmm? And also, S1's response here is doing exactly what S2 noted on the other thread. S1  are dropping the majority of the topical text, and making more of an interest in that ONE side-note comment... S1 said NAMECALLING and VIOLENCE, Foundit. Those were the things Jason conflated with opposing gay marriage. Once again S2  are being disingenuous again -- respond to what S1 actually SAID for once. Show where Archie has ever called gays names before, like the f word, or called for violence against gays. If S2 can, I'll be glad to retract the comment. Namecalling and violence are wrong, REGARDLESS of where people fall on the issue of gay marriage. In fact, more importantly, they  are always wrong no matter what the issue. Whatever S2 want to think, Foundit. It's not worth arguing over with a brick wall. Geeez Foundit. S1 suspect personal comments about posters are starting to compete or even outnumber pertinent points about issues S2  are making at this point. S1 think S1  is going to start using an acronymn whenever S2 do so, that says Personal Comments & Attacks Don't Deal with Issues. " PCADDWI ". That way it will be noted when S2 do it, but it allow S2 to continue dragging down the thread with them. ( Or at least you'll be completely alone in doing so. ) PCADDWI. Quote him. Quote EXACTLY what he said. Cause Jason did no such thing... Were S1 looking in the mirror when S1 said that? Are S1 for real? We have already got Archie's " bitchy as a gay " comment. S2 never said he called gays " XXXXXX " before. But ain't it interesting how this board will sensor ###### or ####, but if S1 say XXXXXX, it's A-OK... The fact that S1 argue with me on so many issues, but then throw this arbitrary argument out there, belittles S1's claim and demonstrates an ulterior motive for ignoring the statement. Are S1 going to label S1's own statements as such Jyoshu? Cause S1 have this boring habit of starting passive-aggressive attacks, belittling other people, and then when somebody calls S1 on it or says something about it S1 eventually drop it and act surprised when other people point out S1 dropped it.
@highlight
This is about the use of arguments of violence towards gay-marriage.
@highlight
S1 starts off saying there is a difference between being anti-gay and someone condoning violence against gay people.
@highlight
S2 talks about how violence is used to make people feel threatened to feel a certain way about a topic or debate.
@highlight
S2 used the example of kids being taught about gay marriage in school as a threat.
@highlight
S2 also mentions someone named Archie who posts include a variety of slurs towards gay people.
@highlight
S1 brushes on the topic, but goes off track from the topic quite a bit.
@highlight
These two people start referring to each others "attacks" on each other towards the end.
@highlight
S1 says they were referring to namecalling and violence from the original post that was opposing gay rights.
@highlight
These two aren't really in opposite positions/beliefs, but they are more trying to discuss the ways they argue for or against gay marriage and how it may be portrayed by others.
