S1 think a better comparison is Sodom.......... These are the comments that make S1 a homophobic bigot, not S1's opposition to gay marriage. In S2's mind yes........ When S2 have bath houses in SF that have 100 men in a daisy chain performing unprotected sex on one another S1 would make the comparison to Sodom......... That is not homophobic, that is a fact and S2 should condemn it too........... So, S1 have been there to see this S2 take it or are S1 going on rumors and misinformation. Did S1 read about this on the focus on family website? Sorry, S2 just don't believe you. Go to Yahoo and do a search on San Francisco Gay bath houses if S2 don't believe me....... When the AIDS first came out they were shut down but they are flourishing again now and the occupants have gone back to unprotected sex......... From what S1 have surmised S2 are gay. S1 am surprised S2 did not know that..... YOu made a very specific claim about 100 men in a daisy chain having unprotected sex. It is clear to me that post was not based in fact, but opinion. If S1 don't have the proof of the claim, S1 shouldn't make it! That is what makes S1 a homophobe. S1 make claims about gays without knowing the truth. Why do S2 think they closed the bath houses down in the eighties? This, at last check is 2005, what they did in the 80's has nothing to do with the topic at hand, or S1's comments. So either justify S1's comments or take them back and admit they were uncalled for... Joe S2 need to read the link S1 cited in a post in this thread......... Gays in SF are trying to get the bath houses reopened......... Great! What does that have to do with gay rights? What does it have to do with the title of this thread? How can S1 take what a small group of gays in California are doing and equate it to the behaviors of all gays. That is irresponsible.
@highlight
S1 is against gay rights apparently because of the biblical story of Sodom, and the sexual activities S1 perceives to have occurred in San Francisco bath houses, which S1 asserts the current gay community is trying to re-open.
@highlight
He argues that the gay community is going back to unprotected sex and that a daisy chain of 100 men perform unprotected sex on each other in the bath houses.
@highlight
S2 challenges the assumptions, specifically finding the daisy chain of 100 men a less than credible assertion and admonishes S1 to use facts to support his arguments, not opinions.
@highlight
S2 also notes that S1's apparent fascination with bath houses is not relevant to the gay rights topic under which the posts are being entered.
