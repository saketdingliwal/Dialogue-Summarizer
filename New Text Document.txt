S2 believes the point has been made because different laws affect different people.  S2 attacks S1 by calling their argument \"silly\" because it violates the First amendment rights. S2 remarks that S1 is only concerned with the rights of gay and the anti-gay Christianity. S1 specifically names a woman in particular to admit her discrimination. S1 expresses that the rights of gays is their first concern and protection from church. S1 threatens to respond with similar actions against the church, like protesting ceremonial events and church services.  S2 urges S1 to allow the democratic process to decide the issue, believing the anti-gay movement may also have legitimacy. S1 questions the majority rule ideology because of incidents in the past like slavery and concentration camps., and once again calls out the women. S2 ends by stating those would not be possible today because of the 13th amendment. \n  \n \n \n ----------\n D2\n ----------\n (S1) states how can gay marriage hurt politicians or anyone else? (S2) says that there are laws that hurt all kinds of peoples and argues about violation of the First Amendment by imposing someone's belief over another. (S1) argues that he is only concern with gay peoples rights and says that the politician wants gays to remain as second-class citizens. Argues that politician/she is discriminating and protecting her heterosexual privilege. He also argues that not accepting gay marriage is punishment to him, his family and others. (S2) He argues about the kind of democracy in where majority of the people decide what best for society and how being anti-gay is a right of the First Amendment.  Is a gay person is allowed to have the freedom, so does he who and others who may not agree. (S1) then gives the example that not just because majority rules it means that it's a good thing. For example, enslaving people was accepted in previous societies. (S2) argues that although previous societies had legal rights to enslave people but that doesn't mean that it makes those decisions all the time and that is like gay marriage. \n \n ----------\n D3\n ----------\n \n  \n  \n  S1 asks S2 how equal marriage would hurt someone, \"her\", or anyone else. S1's way of equal marriage would not S1 or her. S1 is only concerned with gay rights and will talk people out of attending bible churches. S1 will try to legally disrupt any of the fundraising activities that they have going on, protest their weddings and their services. Once they crossed the line and enacted laws that hurt S1 and S1's family, then they have no place in society. The majority should not have the right to enslave their fellow citizens and send them to concentration camps. She should admit to her bigotry, discrimination and anti-gay views.\n  \n  \n  S2 is glad that S1 abandoned a silly argument about the violation of the first amendment right, but still does not see why only laws that do not cause harm should be enacted. S2 is surprised at S1's affinity for the harm principle given that S1 has expressed being at war with evangelical anti-gay christianity. S2 holds that people should be about to legislate their views, and wants S1 to explain why that shouldn't be so with anti-gay people. In a democracy like ours people use the democratic process to have views enacted into law. If she is free to do this, then so is S1.\n \n ----------\n D4\n ----------\n S1 questions to how equal marriages hurts the woman or any other heterosexual. The only person that gets hurt is S1. If equal marriage is incorporated into the law then nobody gets hurt. S2 talks about what if a proposed law hurt someone and that there are all kinds of laws that hurt all kinds of people. S1 says he is only concerned with the rights of gay people. He calls the woman evil and that she should admit that she is anti-gay and wants to protect her heterosexual privilege. S2 believes that S1 just cares about gay people but has not shown why anti-gay people should not be able to legislate their view. S2 says that S1 and the woman both have their own opinions. S1 asks whether the majority should have the right to enslave their fellow citizens or lock people up in concentration camps. S2 responds saying the majority did have the right to enslave fellow citizens until the 13th amendment took place and says that the majority wins in the united states."}, {"key": "1-6229_6_5__7_8_9_16_26_29_46_47_48_2", "Dialog": "S1:1-  Agreed She is ignoring my religious freedom and trying to institute her religion into law.

She isn't trying to take away your right to any religious ceremony. With such a wide-open standard of what constitutes religious freedom that you seem to have, any legislation could be construed as imposing on religious freedom.

S2:2-  But by that definition, either one could be viewed as impeding on religious freedom, including your view impeding on hers! We don't define imposing on religious freedom on the basis of having different ideals. It doesn't effect your religion or religious freedom if you don't get benefits under gay marriages. You can argue in other ways, on other basis, but the idea that not giving gays marriage benefits is imposing on religious freedom is an empty \" argument \". S1:3-  But you have not shown how she would be harmed by equal marriage? I have shown that her definition infringes upon my religious freedom. If gay marriage becomes a reality then in no way does it infringe upon her in any way. Would you care to explain how gay marriage infringes upon her in any way? It is her heterosexual privledge and her sence of entitlement that she is protecting not marriage. S2:3-  You may ( or may not ) can show harm in another sense, but you certainly have NOT shown how your religious rights are taken away or harmed, to begin with. That's the point. You certainly have not shown how her definition infringes upon your religious freedom -- you are still free to be just as religious in practice and belief as ever if Musgrave's views became law.

My religious belief says that it's important to smoke in public non-smoking areas. My religious belief says that it's important to drive cars as fast as one can on city streets. My religious belief says that the death penalty should never be enforced. Gee, this it fun, using religion as an excuse and means to an end to fight legislation! Too bad for you it doesn't work that way. What you don't get is that, by your standard, EITHER would be placing one religion over another. The same justification could be made against your view because your view goes against MY religious belief.

How is she hurt if it is my religious belief of equal marriage is turned into law? S2:5-  You have no idea whether or not she is truly trying to turn her religious belief into law. She may just happen to believe that way religiously, but be pushing for the law because she thinks that's best for socety. IOW, you have no idea if religion is her real motivation for the law.

S1 seems to believe that someone is making religion into law by saying marriage should be between a heterosexual couple. S2 is arguing that S1's point is not very valid because S1 is not understanding that they are not using the persons perspective. S1 believes that that person is trying to hurt them, while S2 is saying that the person may not necessarily be that way and that the person may be arguing for what they believe to be greater for society, based on their own perspective. S1's religious view of marriage is based on two people's love for each other, while the other person believes its between a man and woman. S2 says S1's argument is empty and that S1 is not showing how the other person is being hurt by gay marriage. S2 thinks S1 is not understanding the overall perspectives and just focusing on their own needs.

S1 believes that her religious freedom is being persecuted from people against gay marriage.  S1 believes this will result in her family not having legal protection. S2 doesn't believe that S1's religious freedom is being persecuted because she is still bale to hold religious ceremonies. S2 believes the same argument can be made fro m her perspective. S1's believe of marriage is that it should be based on love and not on sex. S2 argues that the religious freedom argument could be used in any format to justify any action. S1 is angered that the religious freedom of another person will go into law and bar her from marriage so she can sustain her heterosexual privilege.  S2 disagrees and thinks \"she\" is doing what she thinks is before society. S1 and S2 seem to get annoyed with each other by the end of dialog.\n \n ----------\n D2\n ----------\n (S1) says that his religious freedom is being ignored by a politician attempting to make her religious beliefs law.  This law limits legal protection of gay couples and it is not use to protect marriage but heterosexual privilege. (S2)  questions how the politicians view is imposing on (S1) religious freedom. (S1) responds that he believes that marriage should be between two people who love each other and not her/politicians belief that marriage should be between man and woman. However, (S2) says that the argument surrounding religious freedom is an empty argument because anyone can argue for his or her beliefs using religion. (S1) says that gay marriage doesn't violate her/politicians rights of heterosexual privilege, entitlement since she is not protecting marriage but her beliefs. (S2) questions how (S1) religious rights are taken away or harmed. (S1) and (S2) discuss about whose religious belief is better for society.

Her religious belief is that marriage should be between a man and a woman but S1 believes that marriage should be between two people in a loving relationship regardless of sex. If she put her religious belief into law it would hurt S1 but if the religious views of S1 are put into law she would still be able to choose who she wanted and S1 would be able to choose whomever.

S2 holds that either if either religious belief were put into law that it would infringe on the other's beliefs. S2 claims that S1 has not shown how the religious beliefs would be taken away from such a law. It can be argued in other ways but the idea of not giving gays marriage benefits is imposing on religious freedom is an empty argument.

If the woman's religious belief gets incorporated in to the law, S1 will not be able to marry the person of his choice but she will still be able to marry regardless of the law. The woman is just trying to keep gay people out of marriage to preserve her heterosexual privilege. S2 argues that either one of them can be impeding on the others religious freedom.

My question to you is : What do you think marriage should mean to our governments? S2:1-  Well, marriage is an ancient human institution, based on the pair bonding that is natural for humans, and is one of the foundations of social stability. Why would it surprise anyone that government might wish to support it? What really surprises me is to find how many alleged Christians NOW find it expedient to demand government \" get out of marriage \", simply because gay people want to get in it. Bunch of hypocrites -- they never complained about government regulating marriage before this. Now, while I agree it isn't absolutely essential for government to be involved in the regulation and support of marriage, it is nevertheless a convenience that few people would really want to throw away. ( Mr. WriteLA has summed it up eloquently so I needn't elaborate. ) Alas, many are just too mean-spirited to share marriage with those pesky homos, so they've jumped on the get-out-of-marriage bandwagon -- which isn't going to go anywhere -- as camouflage for their real feelings. S1:2-  That government would wish to be involved in any aspect of our lives, would not surprise me. That is what governments tend to do. Consider the \" Healthy Marriage Initiative \". This is our government and as citizens, we would be well advised to exercise vigilance to prevent our government from intruding into areas where there is no necessity. Just because a few mean-spirited hypocrites may advocate that the government get out of marriage for the wrong reasons does not mean that the idea is all bad. Never happen? Enlist the 100 single people who have the biggest stake in this issue and chip away at the exclusive benefits. Start with an easy one like hospital visitation and work up to the tough ones like Social Security to spouses S2:2-  Why? Why is it in the interests of society to prevent government involvement in marriage? That's what you haven't explained. MrWriteLA pointed out the reasons that government involvement is pretty much unavoidable, if only because government is the source of law. It seems to me you advocate the replacement of marriage with a plethora of minor and specific legal contracts that would only benefit the lawyers writing them. It's the wood and the trees. If specific laws are trees, then marriage is the forest that protects our relationships from such gales that XXXX. Is there any specific advantage to looking to individual trees and ignoring the wood? S1:3-  Lesz I ask why and you ask why not. Why should government get out of the marriage business : 1. It is not needed 2. The current marriage benefits are terribly unfair to single people that are forced to pay for them. Your eloquence notwithstanding, I have found it useful to look very closely at the trees when solving problems. I would suggest that one cannot understand the wood unless one knows something about trees. Also, I have often found it useful to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller parts and solving the easiest parts first. S2:3-  Why is government support of marriage unfair to single people? Single people do not have the same issues as married people. Having been married and single myself, I do have some insight here. And why would you rather married people go to lawyers for multiple legal contracts to cover all the hundreds of rights and mutual obligations currently conferred by marriage? Are you a lawyer in need of clients? ;) My own experience of woods and trees is that there is no value in looking at them in only one way. One needs to consider them as trees and woods. S1:4-  I have also been single and married. Experience but not much insight. I would be interested to hear your views about this difference in issues and how these issues are helped by government involvement. Lesz, I am an engineer, not a lawyer. S2:4-  Well, single people live by themselves, not as a family. By definition, they do not have a significant relationship -- and no, I don't count boyfriends or girlfriends here, I am referring to committed couples who live together as a family unit. There are many legal issues such as inheritance, pension and social security rights, adoption and child custody, home ownership, etc., which would need separate legal contracts without the umbrella of marriage. ( And of course, even then such contracts would only be enforceable by government. ) I myself had tremendous difficulties sorting out property issues with my partner's family after he died. It all but bankrupted me, and there wouldn't have been any issue at all had it been legal for us to get married. We did have some legal contracts pertaining to the house, and wills, but alas they weren't good enough to get his family off my back, because our legal relationship was trumped by his familial one. I am not saying it couldn't be done piecemeal, tailor-made to suit each individual couple, but wouldn't that be excessively inconvenient -- for everyone but the lawyers?

S1 mentions the \"Healthy Marriage Initiative\" and how it isn't necessary.

Decades of effort from the religious right, conservative republicans, and their like have made gay rights a poisoned topic. It's a tragedy, but saying the right thing on this issue will cost you more votes than it will gain you, everyone knows it, and no one is going to do it. It's politics 101. The democrats, as a whole, want to do the right thing, but they know that if they say so too loudly they won't be in a position to do anything. They're forced to moderate their public stances so that they can get into positions where they can actually take action. This is of course a generalization, but if you're talking about a political party as a whole that's unavoidable. S2:1-  So, you're basically saying that Biden was lying through his teeth when he said he doesn't support gay marriage? It was all just a lie to keep from losing votes? Interesting. S1:2-  Possibly, I couldn't say. Certainly as a democrat he gets more benefit of the doubt than I would give a republican when it comes to gay rights, but I haven't plumbed his record enough to say for sure. And let's be honest here, you do not find the idea that a politician might be lying interesting. :) S2:2-  What I'd prefer is that the candidates be honest about their views, whether it's popular or unpopular. But even knowing we're talking about political candidates ( who may lie to get votes ), when a candidate says something is his or her view, I think we have to take them at what they say when they answer a question like that so directly and emphatically. Otherwise, there's little point in asking questions to begin with other than maybe watching the reaction of body language and how they would respond under pressure, and so forth. Political discourse has to operate to where when a candidate gives a given view as HIS or HER view, they are taken at their word that IS their view. \" No \" can't mean \" yes \" and so forth. S1:3-  No, that's too niave an approach. We know politicians are going to tell some lies, I trust that's a given. We, as political consumers, can't simply take politicians at their word. If we want to make informed decisions about candidates we need to develop the skills to make useful judgement calls about what they're saying. We need to figure out how often they lie, what they lie about, how big their lies are. Obviously we shouldn't need to do this, it would be great if we could actually take our politicians at their word. Bad the sad reality is that we can't, not at this stage anyway. In this particular case, if Biden says he doesn't support gay marriage I'm just as likely to think it's because he knows that open support could cost him the White House as any other reason. It's sad that such double speak is needed, I'd love it if enough courageous politicians stood forth and ended the political need for lies, but until that wonderful day I'm not going to be naive and take everything they say at their word, nor am I going to jump up and down and point fingers at every falsehood. I'll try to judge the politicians by their actions, and their lies by their magnitude, scope, and quantity. S2:3-  I think you are misunderstanding me -- I don't mean I think we should assume they are GOING to always tell the truth -- I mean we should put the expectation on them to be honest. IOW, honesty is what we should demand. If we aren't even going to do that, there's no point in ever asking a political candidate a direct question. Knowing they're going to lie isn't the same as having the expectation on them to be honest. I really don't think it's too much to ask our candidates to say what their views are. You just said yourself \" we need to figure out how often they lie, what they lie about, how big their lies are \" so, obviously, you believe it's not really good that they are lying. There would be little point in asking them questions if we aren't going to hold to them to SOME level of expectation that they're going to say what they mean. Sure, they lie, but if the words of politicians mean nothing, there's little point in even having political discourse.

S2 expresses desire for a candidate who stands behind their beliefs regardless of popular opinion, and not lie to get votes.

In regard to gay rights, the religious right and conservative republicans have made it a poisoned topic such that politicians won't say the right thing because it will cost them votes. Democrats have had to be moderate on the issue in order to still be in a position to do something. It's too naive to expect to a politician to give their view on matters, and so it is necessary to figure out how often they lie, what they lie about, and how big their lies are.

We benefit from families with adopted children, step children, families with no children at all. No it does not. Prove it will come up, and also prove it will come up as a result of same-sex marriage. Marriage is that now. You're right, it has nothing to do with the Bible. It has everything to do with the slippery slope logical fallacy, which we've discussed in the forum ad nauseum. It only shows that those opposed do not have an argument. You know the prospect of incest and polygamy is much less socially acceptable than gay marriage, so you try to erroneously tie polygamy and incest to gay marriage in people's mind to strike fear in them, and hope their logical reasoning can be replaced by irrational fear. S2:1-  a married couple as the head of a home is considered a nuclear family it already has. the question of legality is what this whole issue is about. marriage is a legal instituation, how could legality NOT come up. yes it is whoa... hold up... are you saying that only because gay marriage is less unacceptable that incestuous relations, that its ok to grant gay marriage but not sibling marriage?? if the incestuous society begin to parade and protest, until society accepts them on the level that they accept gays now, what will you say then? on what grounds should we discriminate against 2 siblings wanting to get married, particularly if they believe they truly love each other, or if they believe that they were born with that attraction? this is classic hypocracy. if 2 siblings want to love each other in their private lives, how is that any business of yours? and what does irrational fear have to do with anything? do you have an irrational fear of an incestuous or polygamous lifestyle? based on what? give me one reason why society shouldnt accept an incestuous relation between two consenting adults S1:2-  Then what may lead to incest and polygamy is the fact that marriage is a legal institution, is that what you are saying? If so, these things may come up equally as a result of straight legal marriage or gay legal marriage or interracial legal marriage, or legal inter-faith marriage or legal marriage with legal divorce, etc. It doesn't relate specifically to gay legal marriage at all. I was saying this is how many people attempt an argument against gay marriage, by attempting to incite fear by spouting off a parade of horribles that have nothing to do with the issue of gay marriage. What if straight people are married and winged green monkeys come flying out of everyone's derriere in the future? What will you do then? Demonstrate how gay marriage specifically relates to incest and incestuous marriage and polygamy. This is the gay rights forum, not the incest forum. S2:2-  thats not what im saying. what may lead to incestuous marriage is if siblings or related people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage. and what may lead to polygamous marriage is 3 or more people who love each other and want to live together under the legal union of marriage. do you see a pattern here? ooooh.. nice way to snake out of the issue... let me refresh your memory since you brought it up, what exactly does the social acceptance of any type of \" taboo \" relationship have to do with their right to be legally married? is there a certain limit of \" tabooness \", and if youre past that limit then no marriage for you? and what fear are you talking about? i'm talking about people that love each other and want to tie the knot. how could that possibly strike fear in somebody? please.... S1:3-  Yes, that's true. Yes, that's true. Are you saying love is the pattern? Well, love applies to straight marriages as well as gay marriages. Love is not exclusive to gay marriages. If that's the connection, we can just as easily say straight marriage will lead to incestuous marriage and polygamy. You are saying love will cause a slippery slope. It's still fallacious. The issue I brought up was why this fallacy is often used, that is to create fear, because incest and polygamy are indeed considered so taboo. The issue is not the tabooness of anything and everything, but how it is being used to distract from the issue of same-sex marriage, when there isn't a logical, rational argument against same-sex marriage. It's an indication of desperation on the part of some of those who are against same-sex marriage. I have no reason to discuss the level of acceptability or lack thereof of every single thing, before I accept one thing that is different from all those other things. I can deal with that one thing on all of its own merits and shortfalls, without being drawn into a false dilemma, either accept everything or else don't accept one thing, as if those are the only two choices, fallacy.

Right. Because that is all the oil spill in the gulf is to you... a big joke. S1:3-  If you don't know by now it won't help to point you there again. That's stupid. Being in denial has never stopped God's wrath before. Take another lap around Mt. Sinai, sport. S2:3-  Again with no evidence of what you claim. I asked you to show me where I lied. I can give plenty of examples where you have... Who said anything about being in denial? I was asking why all Americans, even those like myself who believe your book to be nothing more than philosophical fiction, should be subject to your religious whims. S1:4-  Do I look like I'm in charge of the country? Quit your yapping. p.s. Any time you think you can document a New Testament person, place, or event as fiction, then hop out here. Otherwise you're about as believable as his highness, Obama. S2:4-  Thankfully, no. However, you should understand that under our system of government, the power comes from the people. My fight is not against you specifically, but against bigots who feel that they can use their personal religious beliefs to dictate what others may or may not do. If you find yourself included in that category, then theres nothing I can do to help you. No, again Easy... you fail the reading comprehension test. I used the word \" believe \", not proof or evidence. Likewise, you believe in the NT, yet you cannot furnish any proof or evidence in support of it. I have no reason to justify my beliefs to you. You have no right to dictate your beliefs to me. Do you see the difference? S1:5-  And who are you to decide what religious-minded people can and cannot do? Seems like your personal bigotry is getting the better of you. And do you know that if enough Christians, Jews, and others decide to embrace and pass a Constitutional Amendment against, say, gay unions and gay marriages, that it's perfectly legal under our Constitution to do so, and that there's not a darn thing you can do about it? If you don't like what's being sent your way in these forums you can call the liberal politically correct thought police and see if they can help you. p.s.

S1 is against gay rights and believes they earned their freedom of speech through serving in the military. S2 believes everyone has the freedom of speech and is against speaking out towards other kinds of people. S1 is very rude and constantly being immature towards S2. S2 states that we are granted freedom of speech by the constitution, and S1 responds with immature remarks and questions. S2 points out that S1 has no evidence of any sort for his arguments and that believing in the bible should not be a reason to dictate everyone else's rights. Also, S2 adds that he doesn't need to prove his beliefs the same way S1 shouldn't dictate his beliefs. S1 seems to be ignorant to the actual context of the conversation while S2 is in belief that S1 shouldn't use his beliefs to dictate the rights of other individuals.\n \n \n ----------\n D1\n ----------\n \n  \n  S1 and S2 enter a discussion on gay rights and religion impact of legislation. S1 served in the military and they believed they have earned their right to have freedom of speech. S2 points out that gays should be able to do the same but are unable to due to prejudice due to policies that keep gay people from being open about their sexuality. S2 explains to S1 that the right to freedom of speech is guaranteed by the Constitution and gay are not being protected.  S1 is fine with gay serving in the military as long as they stay in closet or they should be kicked out. S2 argues that it is unfair to have laws based on religious text that does serve as everyone's religious text.  S1 responds angrily and with homosexual slurs, and requests that S2 take his comments up with Obama. S2 explains his goal is too preach to the public and not to any specific person.  S1 believes S2 is being prejudice against religious-minded people. \n \n \n ----------\n D2\n ----------\n (S1) states that he has served Uncle Sam and fought for his freedom rights. (S2) responds that (S1) does not thinks that gay people should have the opportunity to serve in the military or have freedom of speech. (S2) also stated that (S1) did not fight for his freedom of speech because that right is guaranteed in the constitution. (S1) accuses (S2) about lying about what other have said. He says that gays can serve but they need to stay in the closet. (S2) challenges (S1) to show him where he lied and states that gays can not say whatever they want to because they'll get kicked out and says that is not freedom of speech. (S1) charges (S2) of being in denial but (S2) defends himself by saying that he never said he was in denial and that the religious book is only a philosophical fiction. (S2) says that his fight is not directly or only with (S1) but with others who think that they can tell people how they need to live their lives based on religious beliefs.\n \n \n ----------\n D3\n ----------\n S1 differentiates himself from others around here who live off the service of others by saying that he has served for Uncle Sam and fought for freedom of speech. Sodom and Gomorrah liberals are a scourge to decent people everywhere. Gay people can serve and say whatever they want, but they need to stay in the closet or else they're out of here. There's consequences on earth and in the hereafter for the stiff-necked crowd. S1 believes S2's position is stupid and that S2 is in denial. S1 doesn't believe that a New Testament person, place, or event should be considered to be fiction.S1 thinks that the personal bigotry of S2 is getting the better of S2.\n  \n  \n  S2 finds it amusing that S1 believes that he fought for the right of free speech but that S1 does not believe that gay people should have it. S2 points out that free speech is inherently protected through the constitution. S2 finds that gay people under S1's view do not have freedom of speech because if gay people say the wrong thing then they get kicked out.The constitution applies to all Americans, even the gays. Not everyone believes S1's religious book, and as such, not everyone feels obligated to abide by that book. Thankfully, you and your like-minded crowd of bigots are a dying breed.

S2 questions S1 to why there should be consequences on earth because S1 believes it is wrong according to his religious book. S2 tells S1 that he has no evidence of what he claims but asks S2 why all Americans should believe S1's book. S2 says the power of the government comes from the people and his fight is again bigots who feels that they can use their personal beliefs to dictate what other may or may not do. S1 questions S2 as to who is he to decide what religious-minded people can and cannot do and says S2's personal bigotry is getting to him."}, {"key": "1-9331_169_167__172_179_183_185_191_206_2", "Dialog": "S1:1-  Dead \" potential \" lives don't have \" real \" or \" actual \" dead bodies.

The fact that you argue with me on so many issues, but then throw this arbitrary argument out there, belittles your claim and demonstrates an ulterior motive for ignoring the statement.

When one dies, who inherits? If one is incapacitied, who decides what the treatment should be? Basically, pretty much none of the marriage benefit laws that are on the book make any sense for groups of more than two, so recongnising group marriages is a huge legal task, and one for which the outcomes are far from obvious. If we're talking about legal recognition, and we are ( right? ), then the cases are wildly different. Our marriage laws, for better or worse, are set up on the assumption of two adults running a household. They also assume man and wife, true, but don't actually depend on that. But the dependence on there being two people is embedded in the laws ; changing that is a huge project. S2:1-  Yes, but gays would also want laws changed to accomodate THEIR form of marriage as well. The fact that one requires less change than the other shouldn't matter, should it? Should having to do more reworking of laws and more paperwork hinder the pursuit of equality? It seems to me your argument boils down to \" polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it. \" Yeah -- such is the price for marriage equality. Let's face it -- if society really wanted to make marriage an open-ended institution of equality rather than for opposite-sex couples which comprise most relationships, they could pull it off -- polygamy, gays, letting 17 year olds marry, etc. All those civil servants are there and can do it as directed as legislation is changed. Means could be set up to determine inheritance, for example. Laws can be worded to do it. S1:2-  See, this is why we try to avoid this debate. Those who oppose gay marriage inevitably put their own spin on it and drag it to silly conclusion. Here we see what gays really want turned into \" make marriage an open-ended institution of equality \", which then means gay, poly, and 17 year olds in this case. Jyoshu stopped there, but it's not uncommon for it then to go to children, cousins, dogs, whatever. This issue is not \" let's let everyone do anything they like \", that's just the common reframing we see whenever poly relations are brought up while disscusing gay marriage. It happens all the time, it gets old, and that's why people who have gone through it a bunch of times tend to aviod the whole thing. S2:2-  It happens because there's no way to avoid logical conclusions. Believe it or not, cultural and legal precedent is a very real thing. The events in the article exemplify this. If you argue to broaden marriage ( which you are ), then this is what you have to deal with. As you said, I DID stop with polygamy, gay, and barely lowering the age of consent, so why are YOU bringing up all the other examples like \" children, cousins dogs, \" or whatever, as if you were ready to pounce on that? You're arguing against degrees that I didn't even say, or that NO one said. Now, do you have any response to my point that your argument boils down to nothing more than \" polygamy requires more work to make the laws accomodate it \", or are you just going to avoid it by getting sidetracked by the fact you don't like that we're even talking about this? Again, society can deal with issues like polygamy if they really want to. S1:3-  Sure there is. You can start with an erroneous assumption, like you did, and then arrive at an illogical conclusion, like you did. Why don't you read the exchanges between me and Phyllis ; I think most of your issues will be addressed that way. S2:3-  Do you feel that opening marriage to gay couples is not a case of broadening marriage? How is that an erroneous assumption? Sure, but I asked you some specific questions that you seem to be avoiding. In your exchange with Phyllis I may comment on matters I disagree with. S1:4-  Listen to yourself! We start with \" gays want to get married \", you change it to \" make marriage an open-ended institution of equality \", and now you segue over to \" broadening marriage \". Your erroneous assumption is your statement of what gays are trying to accomplish. Until you stop trying to change what gays really want into something that you can argue against more easily all your arguments will be based on erroneous assumptions. Actually, I did address them. While debating with Phyllis. Naturally. And naturally I may ignore them if I think they are diversions. S2:4-  What gays are trying or not trying ( in terms of intent ) is not the issue. What is the crux here is that marriage would be broadened. It's not rocket science. You're moving the boundaries of what constitutes a marriage to include MORE than opposite-sex couples. Very straightforward. I know you don't like it phrased that way, but that's what it is. You can't take a phrase like ' gays want to get married \" without looking at the overall implications. In terms of legal rights, I don't see why it would be any different. Equality in marriage is equality in marriage regardless of the cultural motivation -- religious, being in love with more than one person, or simply just for the hell of it. For that matter, the argument could be made that opposite-sex marriage between 2 people is largely a religious construct! S1:5-  I'll try to explain this to you one more time. The stated purpose of gays is quite relevent if you are trying to argue against it. Gays want to get married. One side effect of that is that some people will see the scope of marriage broadened. Gays are not, in and of itself, trying to broaden marriage. They did not wake up one day and say \" let's try to broaden the scope of marriage today, that'll be fun! \" Your arguments run along the lines of \" If you want to braoden marriage, than you must excpet it broadening in all these other ways \" and that's why your rephrasing doesn't work. Broadening marriage isn't the goal, it's a side effect, and since it isn't the goal we don't have to accept all these other things you claim would be the result if they were trying to broaden marriage. To recap, your arguments are based on your assumption that gays want to broaden marriage, that that is their ulitmate goal, the pinnacle of the cause. Gays getting married to you seems to be the means to that end. That is, of course, backwards, and so your sematic based arguments fail. S2:5-  Kronos, I just told you I am not dealing here with what gays are trying / not trying to do in terms of intent, yet you are are arguing as if I never even said that. I am not arguing what gays have as intent. I completely understand what you are saying. My point here is based on the effect of their intents, whatever that intent is. There is simply no way to get around the fact that if you change marriage to include other that opposite-sex couples ( to ANY number of other possibilities -- even ONE ), you are broadening marriage. Whether or not gays set out out to do this in terms of a goal is irrelevant. You are attacking some point about intent that I haven't made -- I'm talking about the effect here. To latch onto some straw man of \" intent \" is to completely miss the point. S1:6-  I'm not ignoring this post, I'm simply choosing not to respond because it's a pointless distraction in an otherwise interesing thread. If you want to start another thread on this theme I'll explain there how wrong you are. S2:6-  Well, you're the one that's taking issue and making it a distraction!", "Summary": "----------\n D0\n ----------\n S1: Opposers to gay marriage often jump to conclusions about who can get married -why not cousins, group marriages, children, dogs? Polygamous marriage raises legal concerns that are not currently covered in traditional marriage laws, for example. The goal of gay marriage supporters is to be able to get married - not to broaden marriage. Broadened marriage is a side effect of legal gay marriage.\r\n \r\n S2: Gay marriage supporters want marriage laws changed to accommodate gay marriage. Broadened marriage could change the current traditional marriage laws. Polygamy, for example, would require more marriage laws changed than gay marriage would, as more people are involved. But if enough people wanted legal polygamous marriage, the laws would be passed. Marriage would be broadened if gay marriage is made legal, whether that is the goal of gay marriage or not.\n \n \n ----------\n D1\n ----------\n Two people are discussing gay marriage and its possible consequences.  S1 contends that our current marriage benefit laws are set up for two adults running a household, so recognising group marriages is a huge task. He points out that even though its for one man and wife, that is not a necessity and would be a much easier task than allowing group marriages.  He argues that the purpose of what gays are trying to do is to get married, and a side effect is that people will see it as the scope of marriage being broadened.  But, broadening marriage to include polygamy and other types of marriages is a side effect that doesn't need to be accepted.  S2 contends that cultural and legal precedent is very real, and that intent is irrelevant.  This is because by seeking gay marriage, the boundaries of what defines marriage is widening to include more than opposite-sex couples and because that, gays are broadening marriage, which inevitably leads to broadening in the other areas.\n \n \n ----------\n D2\n ----------\n S1 believes changing the law to outline group marriages would be a tedious task.  S1 believes transforming to open ended would open the door for other issues such as children being allowed to marry.  S1 believes those who practice other types of unions are using same sex marriage to open the door for other types of unions to be accepted and recognized as well. S1 believes this is the reason most people do not want to broach the subject of polygamist unions advising the goes is not to broaden marriage.\r\n \r\n S2 feels laws will need to be changed to tailor to same sex marriages and the same courtesy should be extended to polygamous marriage.  S2 argues that society can deal with the issue of polygamy without opening the flood gates to include groups such as children, family members, and animals. S2 argues if the institution of marriage is to be changed to include same sex couples, there is no choice but to also face the subject of other types of unions as well.\n \n \n ----------\n D3\n ----------\n S1 (Kronos) and S2 (Jyoshu) are discussing the fact that there are other groups besides the gay community who may want marriage equality rights, such as polygamy advocates or 17 year olds.  Jyoshu sees the changes in law that would be required as an attack on social and legal precedent that can get out of control or be difficult to implement.  Kronos complains that this is a frequent tactic of anti-gay marriage advocates who unfairly claim  that gays want to \"make marriage an open ended institution.\"  Jyoshu notes that whatever the intent, the result is the kind of change the anti-gay advocates warn against.  Kronos asserts that specific laws could accommodate specific groups.  He also argues that the motivation of gays who wish to marry is sincere and the same as the motivation behind opposite sex marriages, and therefore the broadening of marriage is a side effect and not the goal.  Jyoshu says she understands but complains that gay marriage would open the door to further broadening of marriage.\n \n \n ----------\n D4\n ----------\n S1 argues that group marriages would not make sense under current marriage laws, as they only account for two individuals in a legal marriage. They state that opponents of homosexual marriage tend to argue that a change to marriage law would make it too open ended. This person does not believe that to be true, and argues that homosexuals are not trying to broaden the scope of marriage, but only change the law to be inclusive of themselves. They believe that bringing up hypothetical arguments to the contrary is a distraction.\r\n S2 argues that an effect of homosexuals being allowed to legally marry would lead to even more changes to marriage laws that would include more than simply homosexual relationships. This person believes that allowing homosexual marriage is a case that broadens marriage and if allowed, can open basis for future arguments to broaden the law further. They firmly believe that marriage as an institution is between a heterosexual male and female and that changing that in any way gives legal grounds to continue changing it."}, {"key": "1-5811_33_29__35_38_40_41_43_2", "Dialog": "S1:1-  Don't you think that in 1909 it was probably viewed mostly from a moral standpoint? I don't think they saw it the same way they would see black people. They didn't even realize that ' homosexuality ' was any sort of innate thing. It was entirely behavioral to them. I tend to agree with the court, even given what you've said. I doubt for 1909 it was about prejudice and bigotry -- they genuinely felt it was wrong. The concept of gay marriage was completely foreign and unknown in 1909. It wasn't even something they conceived of. I think the court is saying that they couldn't have been prejudiced against something they didn't even know of or conceive of. S2:1-  Hogwash. It was once entirely moral to believe certain races were inferior, and that women had fewer rights than men. Treating the races and women as equal was not something even thought of by many. It was prejudice against gays then, and it still is today. S1:2-  This is not really true. It's a popular misconstruing of morality and history by proponents of modern ' rights ' movements, but it's not true. There's little historical backing to the idea that people believed oppressing black people was a right thing to do, as in, doing good. There were times they used an argument where religion was wrongly used to justify their behavior, but that's a different matter. If you firmly believe otherwise, I'd challenge you to show where people thought oppressing blacks was an example if doing good. The same goes for misogyny. Furthermore, it's beside the point anyway. We're talking about homosexuality. In 1909, the only thing they really understood about the issue at hand was that some people engaged in sexual relations with people of their own gender. There were no articles about \" homosexuality \" as a trait, and certainly none about genetic causes. It was understood entirely from a behavioral standpoint, and therefore a moral standpoint. So it's not hogwash at all -- they really did view gay sex as immoral. If you don't think so, then you have a very poor grasp on history in this case. S2:2-  This kind of morality is based on nothing but ignorance ( which you admit ) and prejudice. What kind of a basis is that for a so-called moral code? So what if it involves behaviour? Gay people have sex, develop relationships, and bond, just like everyone else, but in a way that reflects their gay sexuality. This does not mean people could not be prejudiced about the way gay people live. People were, and are so prejudiced. S1:3-  A better reverse analogy would have been to say \" So then conversly I have the right to advocate that heterosexual relations are morally wrong \". Not heterosexuality, since it's not homosexuality ( as it's a state of being ) that religious people have a problem with. Heck, they often don't even recognize it. With that caveat, yes you are certainly free to advocate whatever you want to be morally wrong. ( And unlike the way some in your movement do, I won't call you a \" bigot \" for doing so! ) It may have been based on \" ignorance \", but I reject the notion it was based on prejudice ( and therefore I tend to agree with the 6 - 0 view of the justices here ). The 1909 society had too little understanding of gay people to be prejudiced over in the first place. Remember, homosexuality was not understood as a state of being at that time. The term itself had not been around long and was not known to most people. And even to those it was known to, it was not known as a state of being. And there certainly was no social identity among gay people as a group -- how could prejudice have existed if there was nothing ( from their perspective ) to be prejudiced toward? S2:3-  Right. Provided gays don't live gay, but live straight, gays can be as gay as they want. As long as gays don't outwardly show what makes them different from straights, gays can be as gay as they want. It's bs. Also some may not recognize the existence of gay people or their gay lives, but that is putting one's head in the sand. Nonsense. People would widely and hatefully use the term \" sodomite \" to refer to gays. Before that the term was \" molly \". Clearly there was an identity they were prejudiced towards. They were rounding up gays in areas they were known to attend, and putting them in prison. Read up on the trial of Oscar Wilde. Gays may have been forced underground, to a greater extent, but that does not mean they were not thought of. Gays were just not thought of in a nice way. Gays were purposely kept out of everything in society, when society didn't really think of gays as human too. That isn't prejudice? S1:4-  Because they didn't approve of sodomy! Do you not agree they didn't understand the concept of homosexuality??? There was no social identity. When they were put on trial, it wasn't because they were gay ( which they had no concept of ), it was because they had gay relations which society viewed as wrong! No, here's where you don't get it -- it's not that \" gays \" ( there was no concept of that ) were purposely kept out of of everything, it's that people who had sodomy relationships were kept out of everything, because sodomy was viewed as wrong. They really did think it was wrong!

There was little historical evidence to prove that people in 1909 believed that it was \"right\" or \"good\" to oppress black people or women, and this sentiment extend to homosexuals. In 1909, people knew that gay sex occurred and they understood its occurrence to be entirely behavioral, and therefore, immoral. Homosexuality was not understood as a social identity back then, so there was no \"gay lifestyle\" to be prejudiced against. Sodomy was criminalized, not being gay.\r\n \r\n S2: There was prejudice against gays in 1909 just as there is now. The immorality of homosexuality in 1909 is based on ignorance. As long as gay people \"lived straight\", they could be as sexually non-normative as they wanted to be. There were terms for gay men back then, like sodomite and molly, so there was a clear identity for people to be prejudiced against.

S1 makes the argument that in 1909, homosexuality was viewed from a moral standpoint instead of being about prejudice and bigotry, since they didn't realize that homosexuality was a state of being and thought it was purely behavioral.  S2 contends that it was once moral to have racial and gender inequality based on prejudice, so prejudice against gays was around even then.

He states that 1909 society had to little understanding of homosexuality to be prejudiced.  To contradict, S2 states that people hatefully used the term \"Sodomite\" to refer to gays, were put in prison and kept out of everything in Society.

S1 rejects the point of gays having been forced to conform to society and cites that hetero-society did not believe in sodomy and due to this would not support relationships between two males.\r\n \r\n S2 compares the treatment of homosexuals in that era with the oppression of the black race and the belief women were a lesser gender.  S2 believes the morality of the era was based on ignorance and prejudice as it is today. S2 advises the moral system used in that era was prejudice based on ignorance and society is plagued by the same ignorance and non-morals. S2 also believes gays were not thought of as human.  Free to be gay as long as they weren't openly gay.\n \n \n ----------\n D3\n ----------\n S1 and S2 are discussing society's attitude toward homosexuality in 1909 in reaction to a court case addressing a 1909 issue.  It is not clear when the opinion was issued, but S2 suggests that the unanimous opinion of 6 judges implies that a ruling in 1909 against homosexuality was not based on prejudice because the act of homosexuality was viewed more as a crime rather than membership in a group.  S1 asserts that there have always been homosexuals and prejudice against them, citing Oscar Wilde for example.  S2 argues that genetic causes were not considered at the time, that homosexuality was deemed misbehavior, and in the past were repressed enough to not constitute a known community which could be discriminated against.  S1 likens historical discrimination against the gay community to historical discrimination against blacks with slavery and women with misogyny.  S2 differentiates the latter two by arguing that nobody openly supported slavery or misogyny as a good and moral thing, whereas the prosecution of sodomy was considered a routine legal proceeding.\n \n \n ----------\n D4\n ----------\n S1 believes that in 1909, the stance against homosexuality was based on a moral obligation and not prejudice because homosexuality at that time was viewed as behavioral and not genetic. This person parallels the treatment of women and blacks during that time period and state that it was viewed, back then, as morally right. They argue that since most people viewed homosexuality as a behavior and not a state of being in 1909, it couldn't have been prejudiced. This person does not believe that there was a social identity among homosexuals in 1909 because society viewed it as morally wrong.\r\n S2 argues against the idea that ignorance is a reasonable excuse for prejudice. This person also uses the parallel of treatment of blacks and women, but argues that morality was an excuse to hide the prejudice. They argue that ignorance is what led to a distinct prejudice towards certain lifestyles and people, and argues against the idea that there wasn't a social identity for homosexuals in 1909 when there was obvious disapproval aimed in their direction."}, {"key": "1-5811_79_77__80_84_87_91_92_95_96_1", "Dialog": "S1:1-  We all know the possibility exists.

S1:2-  I didn't start with that premise, it's simply the most likely answer. I know of no moral system that condones hurting others when said harm isn't preventing some other harm, so morals are out. Religion is a good reason for choosing your own actions but it's no reason for telling others how to live, so that's out. Prejudice against gays has been around for ages, so that's quite likely. And no other explanations come to mind. Straight forward. I'm sure I've explained this to you before, and have invited you to come up with alternate explanations. I do so again. I'm particularly interested to see your response now that you seem to have gotten over the idea that simply calling something moral or religious does not mean that it can't be prejudice at the same time. S2:2-  And neither does Christianity. It TOO is a moral system. That's why when people claim religion in their acts of prejudice, they are actually abandoning that moral system, rather than engaging in it. So yes, morals are out -- I'm glad you're seeing that now. S1:3-  So you finally see that people can claim a moral or religious stance while not actually having one? Excellent! Glad to hear it. Now, care to address the matter at hand? Can you show me, preferably in reality as opposed to a hypothetical, how one could justify pushing an anti-gay agenda based on actual morals or religion? Because I've never seen it myself. S2:3-  Nice attempt at trying to refute a point that hasn't even been made here. The matter at hand is that prejudice may in fact not be what's behind people's opposition to gays being in romantic relationships. In some cases ( well, I'd say MANY cases ) it's religious belief, which may be separate from prejudice. The people I've been around who fel that way were doing it because of their religious beliefs. In fact, it's MY reason as well. S1:4-  Actually it was my point. You've refused to acknowledge this so many times in the past that I couldn't even count. I'm glad you're past it now. Fine, than if it's your reasoning than spell it out for me. Don't worry about anyone else's reasoning, just give me yours. Take me, step by step, from \" this is my religious belief \" to \" therefore other people shouldn't be gay ( or act gay or whatever ) \". Leave nothing out, spell out your assumptions, give me the whole ball of wax. Because in all my years I've never once seen anyone come close to doing so without resorting to prejudice.

People can conceivably lie about anything -- we can't base our discussion on the worry that people might be lying about their stance ; that could be the case in ANY situation about ANY issue. No, it's a religious belief. There's no more \" reasoning \" to it than believing in faith that Christ is a ressurected being. I believe it because it's Biblical -- it's what the Bible says. That's WHY I believe people shouldn't do it. It's not so complicated, really. No one is saying YOU have to believe that way. But it is the way I believe, and that's my business. If I imposed my beliefs, that would be one thing, but I don't. I don't impose anything on you or anyone else, nor do I want to. Get it? S1:5-  And yet I can't see how you made that jump. You believe, fine. But why shouldn't other people do it? What do your beliefs have to do with other people's actions? So you don't impose? You don't take any action which could have an obvious negative impact on another person based solely on your religious beliefs?

S2 asserts vaguely that her belief that \"Christ is a resurrected being\" somehow absolves her of prejudice in being generally opposed to homosexuality.  S1 seems inclined to grant her leeway based on such a religious objection, but requests more specifics as to why a Christian must oppose homosexuality and admonishes S1 not to actively agitate against the gay community or advocate for public policies which are discriminatory.

S1 states that in the next 20 years the wave of gay marriage legalization will be over, to which S2 states that if Congress removes the Defense of Marriage Act, the full faith and credit clause is a clear constitutional mandate.  S1 rebuts saying that even without the federal DOMA, the choice of law doctrine means that states can choose not to recognize gay marriage, or even be forced to recognize another state's gay marriage.  He also states that the full faith and credit clause has never been used in that way, and due to the lengthy legal argument involved it is unlikely to be used.  To contradict this, S2 states that each Justice will vote to side with gay marriage, and there is a current tradition of one state respecting another's marriage license when it comes to heteros, a tradition that will be kept if gay marriage laws are passed.\n \n \n ----------\n D2\n ----------\n S1 believes New England and New York will pass gay marriage and the West Coast will as well; however, S1 also believes the influx of states to recognize the unions will drop off for as many as 30 years.  S1 also believes the removal of DOMA will not effect the outcome nationally advising each state has a right to pass or not pass in the state as well as the fact one state does not have to recognize another state's laws; meaning, just because someone is married in New York does not mean Pennsylvania would have to recognize that marriage. S1 feels courts will rely upon choice of law doctrine for guidance.\r\n \r\n S2 does not agree with this information and believes if DOMA is removed gay marriage will be passed nation wide.  S2 also feels the majority of Justices will vote pro gay marriage should DOMA be removed from the equation.  Also, there is a belief each state will eventually recognize the unions entered into in states which do allow gay marriage.\n \n \n ----------\n D3\n ----------\n S1 and S2 are pondering the future of gay marriage laws in the United States.  S1 posits that States on the East and West Coasts will have gay marriage laws, but that mosts states will be able to prevent them with laws of their own which define marriage as between a man and a woman.  S2 is optimistic that the Supreme Court will find State laws that ban gay marriage unconstitutional if Congress acts to remove DOMA [Defense of Marriage Act].  S1 questions why the Court doesn't find DOMA unconstitutional, to which S2 asserts it has not had the opportunity to do so yet.  S2 also argues that choice of law rules in the various States will result in gay marriages not being recognized in States where there is no gay marriage, and that States have historically already done so on that basis.  He further asserts that resort to choice of law rules means that the FFC [Full Faith and Credit Clause] of the Constitution is not addressed in this context.\n \n \n ----------\n D4\n ----------\n S1 believes that new England and New York will have gay marriage within the next few years and that the west coast might come soon after. They argue that after this time period, gay marriage legislation will stop for the next twenty years or so and that thirty states already define marriage as between one man and one woman. They do not believe that the supreme court would overturn gay marriage bans as unconstitutional and believes that states will ultimately be the ones to recognize whether it should be legal or not. They argue that current marriage laws are disputed between states and have been for decades and believes that the courts will be unable to intervene.\r\n S2 believes that a federal recognition of gay marriage will be soon coming, and argues against S1's claims on the basis of Roberts and Alito being constitutional literalists. They believe that there is enough support in the Supreme Court to follow the constitution as written and that it will find any laws prohibiting gay marriage unconstitutional as a result."}, {"key": "1-9522_9_1__12_13_32_36_49_52_53_1", "Dialog": "S1:1-  Withers : DC Council votes for gay marriage By James Withers, contributing editor, 365 Gay Blog 12.15.2009 3:32 pm EST In a 11 - 2 vote, the City Council of Washington, DC voted for gay marriage. We are a bit short-handed today, so expect more about this later. Until then have a sip of the bubbly and congrats to the District. S2:1-  Wait until it's put on a ballot for the voters to decide. This isn't the first time that a liberal government didn't pay attention to the will of the people. S1:2-  And what is the will of the people JP? People in support of marriage equality is steadily growing. Compare the polls from ten years ago to now to see... It is only a matter of time before equality stands upon the side of the majority. S2:2-  I keep hearing gays say that but every time it's put to a vote, you lose. I'd say that it's time to try another tact because the current one is a losing proposition. The only thing forcing gay marriage on a population does is galvanize them against the forced action. And when they respond on the ballot, they do so punatively. Just wait until you see the repercussions of the current efforts to give ALL Federal Employee's same sex partners bennies on OUR DIME despite DOMA. I'm guessing that some additional Democratic heads will roll in the fall election if that flies. You need a PR strategy that highlights the advantages of gay unions over bathhouse and gay bar existences. I believe that a true majority of people would support civil unions but NOT marriage. And I count myself amongst that majority. S1:3-  Actually JP so far 5 states have passed gay marriage so no not every time it is put to a vote do we lose. And how am I forcing anyone to accept gay marriage? Am I forcing these voters to attend my wedding or dare I say be in a marriage themselves? And I cannot agree with you more about changing the image of the gay community as a whole.. We are not all a bunch of promiscuous sex crazed people running around... What I find funny is once strait people find out how boring we really are, and how we pay taxes just like every other joe schmo they'll think nothing more of special rights lol... But actually like I stated earlier in another thread if those unions constituted the same legal rights as married couples I would be content. S2:3-  Which 5 states put gay marriage on the ballot and it won? To the best of my knowledge, no state that has gay marriage today has ever gotten it via the ballot. It has either been the court or legislature that has forced it on the state. The gays I know are as boring as Mr and Mrs John Q. Public as well, but that's not the image that is portrayed to the general public. Like I said, you have a PR problem. I think that if more gays were willing to settle for civil unions that were more equivalent to marriage, you'd have an easier time gaining legal acceptance. S1:4-  Ok maybe not the ballot... Got me there man. Lol.... Maine was a close one though. And yeah we got a MAJOR PR problem big time... And I said as long as we got the legal rights of marriage and called it CU I would be cool with that. I already wear a dress and heels enough as it is! lmao jk....

Civil unions will not be accepted in place of marriage, as they do not allow the same legal rights as marriage.\r\n  \r\n S2:  Councils and legislatures may vote in favor of gay marriage, but it has yet to be the majority vote of the people. Gay marriage should be played in a positive light by its supporters, because the current public perception of gay men is that they are promiscuous and lead a \"gay lifestyle\" that is offensive. Anti-gay marriage supporters will support civil unions in lieu of gay marriage, and homosexuals should be satisfied with that.\n \n \n ----------\n D1\n ----------\n Two people are discussing gay marriage.

S1 also acknowledges the negative image gays have received is part of the reason some will not accept the concept of gay marriage an advises work is needed to change these stereotypes in order to move forward.\r\n \r\n S2 believes once brought to a public vote, marriage equality will not be passed and believes a majority of people would support civil unions but not marriage of same sex couples due to insurance benefits and other benefits afforded to married couples.

He argues that a majority of people, including himself, would support laws providing rights and benefits for gays who elect to enter into civil unions, but not gay marriage.  He asserts no electorate would vote for gay marriage.  S1 refutes the suggestion by noting that 5 States had already approved gay marriage.  He also notes that gay marriage laws would not force heterosexuals to enter into them or attend gay weddings.  S2 seemingly corrects S1 by noting that the States in question had not put the issue to the general public for a vote.  S1 states that he would be happy with civil union laws, and each of them agree that the gay community has a PR problem and that many homosexuals are actually boring and inconspicuous.\n \n \n ----------\n D4\n ----------\n S1 believes that since support for marriage equality is growing, it is only a matter of time before the majority votes in its favor.

They state that any step towards viewing homosexuals as normal people is a good thing, and that even viewing civil unions in a positive light would and could be enough.\r\n S2 does not believe that marriage equality is something that the majority of the voters wish to see enacted. This person argue that any legislation put into motion has been pushed around the voters, and never accounted for on an actual ballot. They refute S1's argument that five states have passed gay marriage legislation on the grounds that it was not done via the voters, and never actually put on a ballot.

S1 contends the remark pertaining specifically to 100 men shows this information is based more on opinion than fact.

He then asks S2 to go to a cite link to see how gays are trying to reopen bath houses in San Francisco.\n S2 argues that S1's comments make him a bigot.

S2 thinks this is rumors and misinformation. He questions if S1 got the information from Focus on the Family. He thinks there is no proof of that and it's a homophobic opinion.

S1 questions what God enforces marriage rules if it is performed by a judge.
